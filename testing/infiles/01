.revision changed
.chapter "First chapter"  "" "abbrev"
This is text before the first section.
.revision off

.section "First section"
.index primary secondary
This is the text of the first section.
We are going to have an index in the middle of a paragraph.
.index "primary two" "secondary two"
This is the rest of the paragraph.

.section "Second section"
This is the text of the second section. Here's a reference to 
chapter &<<CHAPsecond>>&. Here are some entities, both local and default:
&&abcd; is &abcd;; &&rhubarb; is &rhubarb;.

.chapter "Second chapter" "CHAPsecond"
This is the second chapter. Test a block quote:

.revision "changed"
.blockquote
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have 
their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts.
.endblockquote

.ilist
This is the first item in an itemized list.

There is more than one paragraph.
.next
This is the second item in an itemized list.
.endlist

.olist
Now we have an ordered list.

Again more than one paragraph.
.next
The second item.
.next
The third item
.endlist

.revision off

.olist "lowerroman"
Try lower case roman numerals.
.ilist
Try a nested list.
.next
next
.endlist
back in the first of the ordered.
.next
the next
.endlist

This is a normal text paragraph.
.revision changed
.display
This is a display where the font
should be normal
even recognizing &'italic'& and stuff
but the
layout is literal
.endd
.revision off
.code
This, however is a code paragraph
where &'italic'& everything except
<angle> brackets is totally literal,
and & is no longer a flag.
.endd
And now we are back to a &*normal*& paragraph again.

.itable
.row 1 2
.row 3 4
.endtable

.itable all 1 1 3 1* left 2* center 3* right
.row 1 2 3
.row 4 5 6
.endtable

.vlist
.vitem &*First*&
This is a paragraph about the first item.

In fact, here is a second paragraph.

.vitem &*Second*&
And now we have the second item.
.endlist


The quick brown fox

  note concats
<and stuff>  
Test &copy; and &#1234; and &#x4dc4; for size. 

Check `quote' marks. And ``doublequote'' marks.

This is a paragraph
where things happen over multiple
lines.

Test some of the standard flags &'italic'& and &*bold*& text and 
&`literal`& text and &_filename_& in text and &"quoted"& text and
we have && and &-- as single replacements.
