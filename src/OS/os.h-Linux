/* Some versions of Linux need explicit sync-ing of directories as well as
files. This setting requests that. If the directory is on NFS, it may not
be possible to sync it - in that case, Exim now should ignore the error. But
if you have problems in that area, try undefining this. But be aware that you
may be in a situation where files are not being properly "committed to stable
storage" as quickly as Exim thinks they are. */
