/* iconv arg2 type: libiconv in Ports uses "const char* * inbuf" and was
 * traditionally the only approach available.  The iconv functionality
 * in libc is "char ** restrict src".
 *
 * <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/using-iconv.html>
 * says that libc has iconv since 2013, in 10-CURRENT.  FreeBSD man-pages
 * shows it included in 10.0-RELEASE.  Writing this in 2017, 10.3 is the
 * oldest supported release, so we should assume non-libiconv by default.
 * (Actually, people still using old releases past EOL; we shouldn't support
 * them but I don't want to deal with howls of complaints because we dare
 * to not support the unsupported, so guard this on FreeBSD 10+)
 *
 * Thus we no longer override iconv.
 *
 * However, if libiconv is installed, and anything adds /usr/local/include
 * to include-path (likely) then we'll get that.  So define a variable
 * which makes the libiconv try to not interfere with OS iconv.
