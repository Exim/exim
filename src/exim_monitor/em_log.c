/* We have to detect when the log file is changed, and switch to the new file.
In practice, for non-datestamped files, this means that some deliveries might
go unrecorded, since they'll be written to the old file, but this usually
happens in the middle of the night, and I don't think the hassle of keeping
track of two log files is worth it.

First we check the datestamped name of the log file if necessary; if it is
different to the file we currently have open, go for the new file. As happens
in Exim itself, we leave in the following inode check, even when datestamping
because it does no harm and will cope should a file actually be renamed for
some reason.

The test for a changed log file is to look up the inode of the file by name and
compare it with the saved inode of the file we currently are processing. This
accords with the usual interpretation of POSIX and other Unix specs that imply
"one file, one inode". However, it appears that on some Digital systems, if an
open file is unlinked, a new file may be created with the same inode while the
old file remains in existence. This can happen if the old log file is renamed,
processed in some way, and then deleted. To work round this, also test for a
link count of zero on the currently open file. */
