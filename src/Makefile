# Top-level makefile for Exim; handles creating a build directory with
# appropriate links, and then creating and running the main makefile in that
# directory.

# IRIX make uses the shell that is in the SHELL variable, which often defaults
# to csh, so put this in to make it use the Bourne shell. In systems where
# /bin/sh is not a Bourne-compatible shell, this line will have to be edited,
# or "make" must be called with a different SHELL= setting.

SHELL=/bin/sh
RM_COMMAND=/bin/rm

# If a build name has not been specified by running this make file via a
# command of the form "make build=xxxx", then determine the name of the
# operating system and the machine architecture and use that. This does not
# provide an override for the OS type and architecture type; they still have
# to be used for the OS-specific files. To override them, you can set the
# shell variables OSTYPE and ARCHTYPE when running make.
#
# EXIM_BUILD_SUFFIX should be used to enable parallel builds on a file
# system shared among different Linux distros (same os-type, same
# arch-type). The ../test/runtest script is expected to honour the
# EXIM_BUILD_SUFFIX when searching the Exim binary.
# NOTE: EXIM_BUILD_SUFFIX is considered *experimental*.
