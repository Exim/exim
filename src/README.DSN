              *) fix ENVID and ORCPT addition in SMTP transport
                *) p was not moved to the end of the string. new content
                   added afterwards overwrites ENVID and/or ORCPT
              *) change spool file format to be compatible with the
                 extensible format of exim 4 by prepending new values and
                 setting the extended bitmask accordingly
                *) use SUPPORT_DSN_LEGACY=yes in Makefile to be able to read
                   the legacy format of older patches until all messages are out of queue.
              *) change "dsn" boolean toggle to "dsn_advertise_hosts" to
                 be able to select who actually can use the extension
              *) Add all RFC 3461 MUST fields to delivery-status section
              *) convert xtext in ENVID
              *) add all successful rcpts to ONE message instead of sending several messages

26-Apr-2014 : Version 1.5
              fixes:
                *) fixed wrong order for ENVID
                *) fixed wrong Final-Recipient value
                *) af_ignore_failure is ignored for success reports
                *) fixed DSN_LEGACY switch
              improvements:
                *) added MIME "failure" reports
                  *) bounce_return_message is ignored (required by RFC)
                  *) in case RET= is defined we honor these values
                     otherwise bounce_return_body is honored.
                  *) bounce_return_size_limit is always honored.
                  *) message body intro and final text is ignored
                  *) do not send report if DSN flags say NO
                *) added MIME "delay" reports
                  *) do not send report if DSN flags say NO
                *) changed from SUPPORT_DSN to EXPERIMENTAL_DSN

01-May-2014 : Version 1.6
              fixes:
                *) code cleanup
                *) use text/rfc822-headers were applicable
                *) fix NOTIFY=FAILURE

              improvements:
                *) do not truncated MIME messages
                  *) if bounce_return_size_limit is smaller then the actual message
                     only the header is returned
                *) if bounce_return_body or bounce_return_size_limit prevents Exim
                   from returning the requested (RET=FULL) body this fact is added
                   as X-Exim-DSN-Information Header
                  *) this also means that all of the last three parts of the "failure"
                     template are not used anymore

                *) dsn_process switch removed
                  *) every router "processes" DSN by default
                  *) there is no possibility to "gag" DSN anymore since this violates RFC
                *) dsn_lasthop switch added for routers
                  *) if dsn_lasthop is set by a router it is handled as relaying to a
                     non DSN aware relay. success mails are sent if Exim successfully 
                     delivers the message.
                *) redirect routers always "act" as if dsn_lasthop is set

                *) address_item.dsn_aware changed from uschar to int for easier handling.

02-May-2014 : fixes:
                *) Reporting-MTA: use smtp_active_hostname instead of qualify_domain from
                   original patch.

20-May-2014 : fixes:
                *) removed support for EXPERIMENTAL_DSN_LEGACY for codebase inclusion
                *) fixed build of exim_monitor tree
                *) fixed late declaration of dsn_all_lasthop
