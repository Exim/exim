EXIM ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This file is divided into two parts.  The first is the original list maintained
by Exim's author, Philip Hazel, before he retired.  That has two sub-lists of
contributors.  The second main part is an attempt to bring this up-to-date,
using information from ChangeLog and git.

Names may well occur more than once.

There was a five year gap.  It is unlikely that this file is complete.
If you contributed and are not listed, then *please* let us know.  Even if you
don't much care, we want to acknowledge your help.  A contribution isn't just
code, it includes reporting real bugs, helping with tracking problems down,
documentation fixes and more.

(Note that we have patches from folks in various countries and Latin1 is not
 sufficient to handle all of their names acceptably.
 This file should be in UTF-8).

-Phil Pennock, pp The Exim Maintainers.

============================8< cut here >8==============================

I have not been very good at keeping a proper record of all the people who have
sent in patches and other contributions to Exim. I am going to try to do better
in the future by keeping a record in this file. First, I'll put a list of all
those I can recover from the past; then I'll create a new list to which I'll
add new contributors in future. Some regular contributors may appear in both.

I'm going to record people who send in actual patches or who help in detailed
ways. I'm not going to list people who just make a suggestion or report a
bug. I hope that is a reasonable approach.

If you should be on one of these lists and are not, please accept my apologies,
and let me know! Any omissions are solely due to my incompetence. In
particular, the "past" list has certainly lost the names of people who sent in
relatively small patches.

The Exim Maintainers Lists
==========================

We'll start with the Exim Maintainers, who are the people with commit
access to the master git repository and a couple more folk; then we'll list
known contributors since the lists above.  Then we list the folks who work
to make Exim available on various operating systems as porters/packagers.

For the Maintainers, we may list primary focus area.  All maintainers
will have contributed to work outside those areas.  The maintainers'
contributions are initialled in ChangeLog.  Changes from before maintainership
should be listed as a contributor.

For other contributors, we will attempt to track all contributions.  Note that
the entries per-person were added initially by scanning back through the
ChangeLog and git, so are not in chronological order.

[ With names from all over the world, we need one sort order.  I've arbitrarily
  decreed it to be "normal British address-book sort order, but based on family
  name rather than whichever comes last and using whatever seems sanest for
  sort order of characters which do not collate onto an English character",
  which should handle the majority of cases.  If it is not adequate for some
  situation, we'll resolve it then.
  We leave out titles and honourifics, just names and handles. ]
