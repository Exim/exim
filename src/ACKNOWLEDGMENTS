EXIM ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I have not been very good at keeping a proper record of all the people who have
sent in patches and other contributions to Exim. I am going to try to do better
in the future by keeping a record in this file. First, I'll put a list of all
those I can recover from the past; then I'll create a new list to which I'll
add new contributors in future. Some regular contributors may appear in both.

I'm going to record people who send in actual patches or who help in detailed
ways. I'm not going to list people who just make a suggestion or report a
bug. I hope that is a reasonable approach.

If you should be on one of these lists and are not, please accept my apologies,
and let me know! Any omissions are solely due to my incompetence. In
particular, the "past" list has certainly lost the names of people who sent in
relatively small patches.
