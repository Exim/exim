An atom is a sequence of any characters except specials, space, and controls.
The specials are ( ) < > @ , ; : \ " . [ and ]. This is the rule for RFC 822
and its successor (RFC 2822). However, RFC 821 and its successor (RFC 2821) is
tighter, allowing only letters, digits, and hyphens, not starting with a
hyphen.

There used to be a global flag that got set when checking addresses that came
in over SMTP and which should therefore should be checked according to the
stricter rule. However, it seems silly to make the distinction, because I don't
suppose anybody ever uses local domains that are 822-compliant and not
821-compliant. Furthermore, Exim now has additional data on the spool file line
after an address (after "one_time" processing), and it makes use of a #
character to delimit it. When I wrote that code, I forgot about this 822-domain
stuff, and assumed # could never appear in a domain.

So the old code is now cut out for Release 4.11 onwards, on 09-Aug-02. In a few
years, when we are sure this isn't actually causing trouble, throw it away.

March 2003: the story continues: There is a camp that is arguing for the use of
UTF-8 in domain names as the way to internationalization, and other MTAs
support this. Therefore, we now have a flag that permits the use of characters
with values greater than 127, encoded in UTF-8, in subdomains, so that Exim can
be used experimentally in this way. */

*         Extract operative address              *
*************************************************/

/* This function extracts an operative address from a full RFC822 mailbox and
returns it in a piece of dynamic store. We take the easy way and get a piece
of store the same size as the input, and then copy into it whatever is
necessary. If we cannot find a valid address (syntax error), return NULL, and
point the error pointer to the reason. The arguments "start" and "end" are used
to return the offsets of the first and one past the last characters in the
original mailbox of the address that has been extracted, to aid in re-writing.
The argument "domain" is set to point to the first character after "@" in the
final part of the returned address, or zero if there is no @.

Exim no longer supports the use of source routed addresses (those of the form
@domain,...:route_addr). It recognizes the syntax, but collapses such addresses
down to their final components. Formerly, collapse_source_routes had to be set
to achieve this effect. RFC 1123 allows collapsing with MAY, while the revision
of RFC 821 had increased this to SHOULD, so I've gone for it, because it makes
a lot of code elsewhere in Exim much simpler.

There are some special fudges here for handling RFC 822 group address notation
which may appear in certain headers. If the flag parse_allow_group is set
TRUE and parse_found_group is FALSE when this function is called, an address
which is the start of a group (i.e. preceded by a phrase and a colon) is
recognized; the phrase is ignored and the flag parse_found_group is set. If
this flag is TRUE at the end of an address, and if an extraneous semicolon is
found, it is ignored and the flag is cleared.

This logic is used only when scanning through addresses in headers, either to
fulfil the -t option, or for rewriting, or for checking header syntax. Because
the group "state" has to be remembered between multiple calls of this function,
the variables parse_{allow,found}_group are global. It is important to ensure
that they are reset to FALSE at the end of scanning a header's list of
addresses.

Arguments:
  mailbox     points to the RFC822 mailbox
  errorptr    where to point an error message
  start       set to start offset in mailbox
  end         set to end offset in mailbox
  domain      set to domain offset in result, or 0 if no domain present
  allow_null  allow <> if TRUE

Returns:      points to the extracted address, or NULL on error

If the only characters that strictly need quoting are spaces, we return the
original string, unmodified. If a quoted string is too long for the buffer, it
is truncated. (This shouldn't happen: this is normally handling short strings.)

Hmmph. As always, things get perverted for other uses. This function was
originally for the "phrase" part of addresses. Now it is being used for much
longer texts in ACLs and via the ${rfc2047: expansion item. This means we have
to check for overlong "encoded-word"s and split them. November 2004.

Arguments:
  string       the string to quote - already checked to contain non-printing
                 chars
  len          the length of the string
  charset      the name of the character set; NULL => iso-8859-1
  buffer       the buffer to put the answer in
  buffer_size  the size of the buffer
  fold         if TRUE, a newline is inserted before the separating space when
                 more than one encoded-word is generated

Returns:       pointer to the original string, if no quoting needed, or
               pointer to buffer containing the quoted string, or

/*************************************************
*            Fix up an RFC 822 "phrase"          *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called to repair any syntactic defects in the "phrase" part
of an RFC822 address. In particular, it is applied to the user's name as read
from the passwd file when accepting a local message, and to the data from the
-F option.

If the string contains existing quoted strings or comments containing
freestanding quotes, then we just quote those bits that need quoting -
otherwise it would get awfully messy and probably not look good. If not, we
quote the whole thing if necessary. Thus

   John Q. Smith            =>  "John Q. Smith"
   John "Jack" Smith        =>  John "Jack" Smith
   John "Jack" Q. Smith     =>  John "Jack" "Q." Smith
   John (Jack) Q. Smith     =>  "John (Jack) Q. Smith"
   John ("Jack") Q. Smith   =>  John ("Jack") "Q." Smith
but
   John (\"Jack\") Q. Smith =>  "John (\"Jack\") Q. Smith"

Sheesh! This is tedious code. It is a great pity that the syntax of RFC822 is
the way it is...

August 2000: Additional code added:

  Previously, non-printing characters were turned into question marks, which do
  not need to be quoted.

  Now, a different tactic is used if there are any non-printing ASCII
  characters. The encoding method from RFC 2047 is used, assuming iso-8859-1 as
  the character set.

  We *could* use this for all cases, getting rid of the messy original code,
  but leave it for now. It would complicate simple cases like "John Q. Smith".

The result is passed back in the buffer; it is usually going to be added to
some other string. In order to be sure there is going to be no overflow,
restrict the length of the input to 1/4 of the buffer size - this allows for
every single character to be quoted or encoded without overflowing, and that
wouldn't happen because of amalgamation. If the phrase is too long, return a
fixed string.

Arguments:
  phrase       an RFC822 phrase
  len          the length of the phrase
  buffer       a buffer to put the result in
  buffer_size  the size of the buffer

Returns:       the fixed RFC822 phrase

/*************************************************
*          Extract addresses from a list         *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called by the redirect router to scan a string containing a
list of addresses separated by commas (with optional white space) or by
newlines, and to generate a chain of address items from them. In other words,
to unpick data from an alias or .forward file.

The SunOS5 documentation for alias files is not very clear on the syntax; it
does not say that either a comma or a newline can be used for separation.
However, that is the way Smail does it, so we follow suit.

If a # character is encountered in a white space position, then characters from
there to the next newline are skipped.

If an unqualified address begins with '\', just skip that character. This gives
compatibility with Sendmail's use of \ to prevent looping. Exim has its own
loop prevention scheme which handles other cases too - see the code in
route_address().

An "address" can be a specification of a file or a pipe; the latter may often
need to be quoted because it may contain spaces, but we don't want to retain
the quotes. Quotes may appear in normal addresses too, and should be retained.
We can distinguish between these cases, because in addresses, quotes are used
only for parts of the address, not the whole thing. Therefore, we remove quotes
from items when they entirely enclose them, but not otherwise.

An "address" can also be of the form :include:pathname to include a list of
addresses contained in the specified file.

Any unqualified addresses are qualified with and rewritten if necessary, via
the rewrite_address() function.

Arguments:

                     .forward file or a list of entries in an alias file)

                     not all bits are relevant here - some are for filter
