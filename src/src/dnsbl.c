/* This function is called from verify_check_dnsbl() below. It is also called
recursively from within itself when domain and domain_txt are different
pointers, in order to get the TXT record from the alternate domain.

Arguments:
  domain         the outer dnsbl domain
  domain_txt     alternate domain to lookup TXT record on success; when the
                   same domain is to be used, domain_txt == domain (that is,
                   the pointers must be identical, not just the text)
  keydomain      the current keydomain (for debug message)
  prepend        subdomain to lookup (like keydomain, but
                   reversed if IP address)
  iplist         the list of matching IP addresses, or NULL for "any"
  bitmask        true if bitmask matching is wanted
  match_type     condition for 'succeed' result
                   0 => Any RR in iplist     (=)
                   1 => No RR in iplist      (!=)
                   2 => All RRs in iplist    (==)
                   3 => Some RRs not in iplist (!==)
                   the two bits are defined as MT_NOT and MT_ALL
  defer_return   what to return for a defer

Returns:         OK if lookup succeeded

/*************************************************
*        Check host against DNS black lists      *
*************************************************/

/* This function runs checks against a list of DNS black lists, until one
matches. Each item on the list can be of the form

  domain=ip-address/key

The domain is the right-most domain that is used for the query, for example,
blackholes.mail-abuse.org. If the IP address is present, there is a match only
if the DNS lookup returns a matching IP address. Several addresses may be
given, comma-separated, for example: x.y.z=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2.

If no key is given, what is looked up in the domain is the inverted IP address
of the current client host. If a key is given, it is used to construct the
domain for the lookup. For example:

  dsn.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain

After finding a match in the DNS, the domain is placed in $dnslist_domain, and
then we check for a TXT record for an error message, and if found, save its
value in $dnslist_text. We also cache everything in a tree, to optimize
multiple lookups.

The TXT record is normally looked up in the same domain as the A record, but
when many lists are combined in a single DNS domain, this will not be a very
specific message. It is possible to specify a different domain for looking up
TXT records; this is given before the main domain, comma-separated. For
example:

  dnslists = http.dnsbl.sorbs.net,dnsbl.sorbs.net=127.0.0.2 : \
             socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net,dnsbl.sorbs.net=127.0.0.3

The caching ensures that only one lookup in dnsbl.sorbs.net is done.

Note: an address for testing RBL is 192.203.178.39
Note: an address for testing DUL is 192.203.178.4
Note: a domain for testing RFCI is example.tld.dsn.rfc-ignorant.org

Arguments:
  where		the acl type
  list		the domain/address/data list
  log_msgptr	log message on error

            FAIL    name not found, or no data found for the given type, or
