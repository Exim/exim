/* Exim gets and frees all its store through these functions. In the original
implementation there was a lot of mallocing and freeing of small bits of store.
The philosophy has now changed to a scheme which includes the concept of
"stacking pools" of store. For the short-lived processes, there isn't any real
need to do any garbage collection, but the stack concept allows quick resetting
in places where this seems sensible.

Obviously the long-running processes (the daemon, the queue runner, and eximon)
must take care not to eat store.

The following different types of store are recognized:

. Long-lived, large blocks: This is implemented by retaining the original
  malloc/free functions, and it used for permanent working buffers and for
  getting blocks to cut up for the other types.

. Long-lived, small blocks: This is used for blocks that have to survive until
  the process exits. It is implemented as a stacking pool (POOL_PERM). This is
  functionally the same as store_malloc(), except that the store can't be
  freed, but I expect it to be more efficient for handling small blocks.

. Short-lived, short blocks: Most of the dynamic store falls into this
  category. It is implemented as a stacking pool (POOL_MAIN) which is reset
  after accepting a message when multiple messages are received by a single
  process. Resetting happens at some other times as well, usually fairly
  locally after some specific processing that needs working store.

. There is a separate pool (POOL_SEARCH) that is used only for lookup storage.
  This means it can be freed when search_tidyup() is called to close down all
  the lookup caching.
