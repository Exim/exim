/* This function is called instead of res_search() when Exim is running in its
test harness. It recognizes some special domain names, and uses them to force
failure and retry responses (optionally with a delay). Otherwise, it calls an
external utility that mocks-up a nameserver, if it can find the utility.
If not, it passes its arguments on to res_search(). The fake nameserver may
also return a code specifying that the name should be passed on.

Background: the original test suite required a real nameserver to carry the
test zones, whereas the new test suite has the fake server for portability. This
code supports both.

Arguments:
  domain      the domain name
  type        the DNS record type
  answerptr   where to put the answer
  size        size of the answer area

Returns:      length of returned data, or -1 on error (h_errno set)

/* Look up the given domain name, using the given type. Follow CNAMEs if
necessary, but only so many times. There aren't supposed to be CNAME chains in
the DNS, but you are supposed to cope with them if you find them.

The assumption is made that if the resolver gives back records of the
requested type *and* a CNAME, we don't need to make another call to look up
the CNAME. I can't see how it could return only some of the right records. If
it's done a CNAME lookup in the past, it will have all of them; if not, it
won't return any.

If fully_qualified_name is not NULL, set it to point to the full name
returned by the resolver, if this is different to what it is given, unless
the returned name starts with "*" as some nameservers seem to be returning
wildcards in this form.  In international mode "different" means "alabel
forms are different".
