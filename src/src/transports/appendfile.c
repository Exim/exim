/*************************************************
*              Main entry point                  *
*************************************************/

/* See local README for general interface details. This transport always
returns FALSE, indicating that the status which has been placed in the first
address should be copied to any other addresses in a batch.

Appendfile delivery is tricky and has led to various security problems in other
mailers. The logic used here is therefore laid out in some detail. When this
function is called, we are running in a subprocess which has had its gid and
uid set to the appropriate values. Therefore, we cannot write directly to the
exim logs. Any errors must be handled by setting appropriate return codes.
Note that the default setting for addr->transport_return is DEFER, so it need
not be set unless some other value is required.

The code below calls geteuid() rather than getuid() to get the current uid
because in weird configurations not running setuid root there may be a
difference. In the standard configuration, where setuid() has been used in the
delivery process, there will be no difference between the uid and the euid.

(1)  If the af_file flag is set, this is a delivery to a file after .forward or
     alias expansion. Otherwise, there must be a configured file name or
     directory name.

The following items apply in the case when a file name (as opposed to a
directory name) is given, that is, when appending to a single file:

(2f) Expand the file name.

(3f) If the file name is /dev/null, return success (optimization).

(4f) If the file_format options is set, open the file for reading, and check
     that the bytes at the start of the file match one of the given strings.
     If the check indicates a transport other than the current one should be
     used, pass control to that other transport. Otherwise continue. An empty
     or non-existent file matches the current transport. The file is closed
     after the check.

(5f) If a lock file is required, create it (see extensive separate comments
     below about the algorithm for doing this). It is important to do this
     before opening the mailbox if NFS is in use.

(6f) Stat the file, using lstat() rather than stat(), in order to pick up
     details of any symbolic link.

(7f) If the file already exists:

     Check the owner and group if necessary, and defer if they are wrong.

     If it is a symbolic link AND the allow_symlink option is set (NOT the
     default), go back to (6f) but this time use stat() instead of lstat().

     If it's not a regular file (or FIFO when permitted), defer delivery.

     Check permissions. If the required permissions are *less* than the
     existing ones, or supplied by the address (often by the user via filter),
     chmod() the file. Otherwise, defer.

     Save the inode number.

     Open with O_RDRW + O_APPEND, thus failing if the file has vanished.

     If open fails because the file does not exist, go to (6f); on any other
     failure, defer.

     Check the inode number hasn't changed - I realize this isn't perfect (an
     inode can be reused) but it's cheap and will catch some of the races.

     Check it's still a regular file (or FIFO if permitted).

     Check that the owner and permissions haven't changed.

     If file_format is set, check that the file still matches the format for
     the current transport. If not, defer delivery.

(8f) If file does not exist initially:

     Open with O_WRONLY + O_EXCL + O_CREAT with configured mode, unless we know
     this is via a symbolic link (only possible if allow_symlinks is set), in
     which case don't use O_EXCL, as it dosn't work.

     If open fails because the file already exists, go to (6f). To avoid
     looping for ever in a situation where the file is continuously being
     created and deleted, all of this happens inside a loop that operates
     lock_retries times and includes the fcntl and flock locking. If the
     loop completes without the file getting opened, defer and request
     freezing, because something really weird is happening.

     If open fails for any other reason, defer for subsequent delivery except
     when this is a file delivery resulting from an alias or forward expansion
     and the error is EPERM or ENOENT or EACCES, in which case FAIL as this is
     most likely a user rather than a configuration error.

(9f) We now have the file checked and open for writing. If so configured, lock
     it using fcntl, flock, or MBX locking rules. If this fails, close the file
     and goto (6f), up to lock_retries times, after sleeping for a while. If it
     still fails, give up and defer delivery.

(10f)Save the access time (for subsequent restoration) and the size of the
     file, for comsat and for re-setting if delivery fails in the middle -
     e.g. for quota exceeded.

The following items apply in the case when a directory name is given:

(2d) Create a new file in the directory using a temporary name, by opening for
     writing and with O_CREAT. If maildir format is being used, the file
     is created in a temporary subdirectory with a prescribed name. If
     mailstore format is being used, the envelope file is first created with a
     temporary name, then the data file.

The following items apply in all cases:

(11) We now have the file open for writing, and locked if it was given as a
     file name. Write the message and flush the file, unless there is a setting
     of the local quota option, in which case we can check for its excession
     without doing any writing.

     In the case of MBX format mailboxes, the message is first written to a
     temporary file, in order to get its correct length. This is then copied to
     the real file, preceded by an MBX header.

     If there is a quota error on writing, defer the address. Timeout logic
     will determine for how long retries are attempted. We restore the mailbox
     to its original length if it's a single file. There doesn't seem to be a
     uniform error code for quota excession (it even differs between SunOS4
     and some versions of SunOS5) so a system-dependent macro called
     ERRNO_QUOTA is used for it, and the value gets put into errno_quota at
     compile time.

     For any other error (most commonly disk full), do the same.

The following applies after appending to a file:

(12f)Restore the atime; notify_comsat if required; close the file (which
     unlocks it if it was locked). Delete the lock file if it exists.

The following applies after writing a unique file in a directory:

(12d)For maildir format, rename the file into the new directory. For mailstore

  /* The locking of mailbox files is worse than the naming of cats, which is
  known to be "a difficult matter" (T.S. Eliot) and just as cats must have
  three different names, so several different styles of locking are used.

  Research in other programs that lock mailboxes shows that there is no
  universally standard method. Having mailboxes NFS-mounted on the system that
  is delivering mail is not the best thing, but people do run like this,
  and so the code must do its best to cope.

  Three different locking mechanisms are supported. The initialization function
  checks that at least one is configured.

  LOCK FILES

  Unless no_use_lockfile is set, we attempt to build a lock file in a way that
  will work over NFS. Only after that is done do we actually open the mailbox
  and apply locks to it (if configured).

  Originally, Exim got the file opened before doing anything about locking.
  However, a very occasional problem was observed on Solaris 2 when delivering
  over NFS. It is seems that when a file is opened with O_APPEND, the file size
  gets remembered at open time. If another process on another host (that's
  important) has the file open and locked and writes to it and then releases
  the lock while the first process is waiting to get the lock, the first
  process may fail to write at the new end point of the file - despite the very
  definite statement about O_APPEND in the man page for write(). Experiments
  have reproduced this problem, but I do not know any way of forcing a host to
  update its attribute cache for an open NFS file. It would be nice if it did
  so when a lock was taken out, but this does not seem to happen. Anyway, to
  reduce the risk of this problem happening, we now create the lock file
  (if configured) *before* opening the mailbox. That will prevent two different
  Exims opening the file simultaneously. It may not prevent clashes with MUAs,
  however, but Pine at least seems to operate in the same way.

  Lockfiles should normally be used when NFS is involved, because of the above
  problem.

  The logic for creating the lock file is:

  . The name of the lock file is <mailbox-name>.lock

  . First, create a "hitching post" name by adding the primary host name,
    current time and pid to the lock file name. This should be unique.

  . Create the hitching post file using WRONLY + CREAT + EXCL.

  . If that fails EACCES, we assume it means that the user is unable to create
    files in the mail spool directory. Some installations might operate in this
    manner, so there is a configuration option to allow this state not to be an
    error - we proceed to lock using fcntl only, after the file is open.

  . Otherwise, an error causes a deferment of the address.

  . Hard link the hitching post to the lock file name.

  . If the link succeeds, we have successfully created the lock file. Simply
    close and unlink the hitching post file.

  . If the link does not succeed, proceed as follows:

    o Fstat the hitching post file, and then close and unlink it.

    o Now examine the stat data. If the number of links to the file is exactly
      2, the linking succeeded but for some reason, e.g. an NFS server crash,
      the return never made it back, so the link() function gave a failure
      return.

  . This method allows for the lock file to be created by some other process
    right up to the moment of the attempt to hard link it, and is also robust
    against NFS server crash-reboots, which would probably result in timeouts
    in the middle of link().

  . System crashes may cause lock files to get left lying around, and some means
    of flushing them is required. The approach of writing a pid (used by smail
    and by elm) into the file isn't useful when NFS may be in use. Pine uses a
    timeout, which seems a better approach. Since any program that writes to a
    mailbox using a lock file should complete its task very quickly, Pine
    removes lock files that are older than 5 minutes. We allow the value to be
    configurable on the transport.

  FCNTL LOCKING

  If use_fcntl_lock is set, then Exim gets an exclusive fcntl() lock on the
  mailbox once it is open. This is done by default with a non-blocking lock.
  Failures to lock cause retries after a sleep, but only for a certain number
  of tries. A blocking lock is deliberately not used so that we don't hold the
  mailbox open. This minimizes the possibility of the NFS problem described
  under LOCK FILES above, if for some reason NFS deliveries are happening
  without lock files. However, the use of a non-blocking lock and sleep, though
  the safest approach, does not give the best performance on very busy systems.
  A blocking lock plus timeout does better. Therefore Exim has an option to
  allow it to work this way. If lock_fcntl_timeout is set greater than zero, it
  enables the use of blocking fcntl() calls.

  FLOCK LOCKING

  If use_flock_lock is set, then Exim gets an exclusive flock() lock in the
  same manner as for fcntl locking above. No-blocking/timeout is also set as
  above in lock_flock_timeout. Not all operating systems provide or support
  flock(). For those that don't (as determined by the definition of LOCK_SH in
  /usr/include/sys/file.h), use_flock_lock may not be set. For some OS, flock()
  is implemented (not precisely) on top of fcntl(), which means there's no
  point in actually using it.

  MBX LOCKING

  If use_mbx_lock is set (this is supported only if SUPPORT_MBX is defined)
  then the rules used for locking in c-client are used. Exim takes out a shared
  lock on the mailbox file, and an exclusive lock on the file whose name is
  /tmp/.<device-number>.<inode-number>. The shared lock on the mailbox stops
  any other MBX client from getting an exclusive lock on it and expunging it.
  It also stops any other MBX client from unlinking the /tmp lock when it has
  finished with it.

  The exclusive lock on the /tmp file prevents any other MBX client from
  updating the mailbox in any way. When writing is finished, if an exclusive
  lock on the mailbox can be obtained, indicating there are no current sharers,
  the /tmp file is unlinked.

  MBX locking can use either fcntl() or flock() locking. If neither
  use_fcntl_lock or use_flock_lock is set, it defaults to using fcntl() only.
  The calls for getting these locks are by default non-blocking, as for non-mbx
  locking, but can be made blocking by setting lock_fcntl_timeout and/or
  lock_flock_timeout as appropriate.  As MBX delivery doesn't work over NFS, it
  probably makes sense to set timeouts for any MBX deliveries. */
