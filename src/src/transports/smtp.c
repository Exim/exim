*           Synchronize SMTP responses           *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called from smtp_deliver() to receive SMTP responses from
the server, and match them up with the commands to which they relate. When
PIPELINING is not in use, this function is called after every command, and is
therefore somewhat over-engineered, but it is simpler to use a single scheme
that works both with and without PIPELINING instead of having two separate sets
of code.

The set of commands that are buffered up with pipelining may start with MAIL
and may end with DATA; in between are RCPT commands that correspond to the
addresses whose status is PENDING_DEFER. All other commands (STARTTLS, AUTH,
etc.) are never buffered.

Errors after MAIL or DATA abort the whole process leaving the response in the
buffer. After MAIL, pending responses are flushed, and the original command is
re-instated in big_buffer for error messages. For RCPT commands, the remote is
permitted to reject some recipient addresses while accepting others. However
certain errors clearly abort the whole process. Set the value in
transport_return to PENDING_OK if the address is accepted. If there is a
subsequent general error, it will get reset accordingly. If not, it will get
converted to OK at the end.

Arguments:
  addrlist          the complete address list
  include_affixes   TRUE if affixes include in RCPT
  sync_addr         ptr to the ptr of the one to start scanning at (updated)
  host              the host we are connected to
  count             the number of responses to read
  address_retry_
    include_sender  true if 4xx retry is to include the sender it its key
  pending_MAIL      true if the first response is for MAIL
  pending_DATA      0 if last command sent was not DATA
                   +1 if previously had a good recipient
                   -1 if not previously had a good recipient
  inblock           incoming SMTP block
  timeout           timeout value
  buffer            buffer for reading response
  buffsize          size of buffer

Returns:      3 if at least one address had 2xx and one had 5xx
              2 if at least one address had 5xx but none had 2xx
              1 if at least one host had a 2xx response, but none had 5xx
              0 no address had 2xx or 5xx but no errors (all 4xx, or just DATA)
             -1 timeout while reading RCPT response

*       Deliver address list to given host       *
*************************************************/

/* If continue_hostname is not null, we get here only when continuing to
deliver down an existing channel. The channel was passed as the standard
input. TLS is never active on a passed channel; the previous process always
closes it down before passing the connection on.

Otherwise, we have to make a connection to the remote host, and do the
initial protocol exchange.

When running as an MUA wrapper, if the sender or any recipient is rejected,
temporarily or permanently, we force failure for all recipients.

Arguments:
  addrlist        chain of potential addresses to deliver; only those whose
                  transport_return field is set to PENDING_DEFER are currently
                  being processed; others should be skipped - they have either
                  been delivered to an earlier host or IP address, or been
                  failed by one of them.
  host            host to deliver to
  host_af         AF_INET or AF_INET6
  port            default TCP/IP port to use, in host byte order
  interface       interface to bind to, or NULL
  tblock          transport instance block
  message_defer   set TRUE if yield is OK, but all addresses were deferred
                    because of a non-recipient, non-host failure, that is, a
                    4xx response to MAIL FROM, DATA, or ".". This is a defer
                    that is specific to the message.
  suppress_tls    if TRUE, don't attempt a TLS connection - this is set for
                    a second attempt after TLS initialization fails

Returns:          OK    - the connection was made and the delivery attempted;
                          the result for each address is in its data block.
                  DEFER - the connection could not be made, or something failed
                          while setting up the SMTP session, or there was a
                          non-message-specific error, such as a timeout.
                  ERROR - a filter command is specified for this transport,

  February 1998: A convention has evolved that ESMTP-speaking MTAs include the
  string "ESMTP" in their greeting lines, so make Exim send EHLO if the
  greeting is of this form. The assumption was that the far end supports it
  properly... but experience shows that there are some that give 5xx responses,
  even though the banner includes "ESMTP" (there's a bloody-minded one that
  says "ESMTP not spoken here"). Cope with that case.

  September 2000: Time has passed, and it seems reasonable now to always send
  EHLO at the start. It is also convenient to make the change while installing
  the TLS stuff.

  July 2003: Joachim Wieland met a broken server that advertises "PIPELINING"
  but times out after sending MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and DATA all together. There
  would be no way to send out the mails, so there is now a host list
  "hosts_avoid_esmtp" that disables ESMTP for special hosts and solves the
  PIPELINING problem as well. Maybe it can also be useful to cure other
  problems with broken servers.

  Exim originally sent "Helo" at this point and ran for nearly a year that way.
  Then somebody tried it with a Microsoft mailer... It seems that all other
  mailers use upper case for some reason (the RFC is quite clear about case
  independence) so, for peace of mind, I gave in. */

connection if there are several waiting, provided we haven't already sent so
many as to hit the configured limit. The function transport_check_waiting looks
for a waiting message and returns its id. Then transport_pass_socket tries to
set up a continued delivery by passing the socket on to another process. The
variable send_rset is FALSE if a message has just been successfully transfered.

If we are already sending down a continued channel, there may be further
addresses not yet delivered that are aimed at the same host, but which have not
been passed in this run of the transport. In this case, continue_more will be
true, and all we should do is send RSET if necessary, and return, leaving the
channel open.

However, if no address was disposed of, i.e. all addresses got 4xx errors, we
do not want to continue with other messages down the same channel, because that
can lead to looping between two or more messages, all with the same,
temporarily failing address(es). [The retry information isn't updated yet, so
new processes keep on trying.] We probably also don't want to try more of this
message's addresses either.

to wait for a response, but on the other hand, there isn't anything one can do
with an error response, other than log it. Exim used to do that. However,
further discussion suggested that it is positively advantageous not to wait for
the response, but to close the session immediately. This is supposed to move
the TCP/IP TIME_WAIT state from the server to the client, thereby removing some
load from the server. (Hosts that are both servers and clients may not see much
difference, of course.) Further discussion indicated that this was safe to do
on Unix systems which have decent implementations of TCP/IP that leave the
connection around for a while (TIME_WAIT) after the application has gone away.
This enables the response sent by the server to be properly ACKed rather than
timed out, as can happen on broken TCP/IP implementations on other OS.

This change is being made on 31-Jul-98. After over a year of trouble-free
operation, the old commented-out code was removed on 17-Sep-99. */

   the DNS. The DNS may yield multiple addresses, in which case insert the
