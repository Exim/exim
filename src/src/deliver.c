for most addresses, where the unique address is just the full address with the
domain lower cased. For homonyms (addresses that are the same as one of their
ancestors) their are complications. Their unique addresses have \x\ prepended
(where x = 0, 1, 2...), so that de-duplication works correctly for siblings and
cousins.

Exim used to record the unique addresses of homonyms as "complete". This,
however, fails when the pattern of redirection varies over time (e.g. if taking
unseen copies at only some times of day) because the prepended numbers may vary
from one delivery run to the next. This problem is solved by never recording
prepended unique addresses as complete. Instead, when a homonymic address has
actually been delivered via a transport, we record its basic unique address
followed by the name of the transport. This is checked in subsequent delivery
runs whenever an address is routed to a transport.

If the completed address is a top-level one (has no parent, which means it
cannot be homonymic) we also add the original address to the non-recipients
tree, so that it gets recorded in the spool file and therefore appears as
"done" in any spool listings. The original address may differ from the unique
address in the case of the domain.

Finally, this function scans the list of duplicates, marks as done any that
match this address, and calls child_done() for their ancestors.

uid and gid as specified. This is a safer way than simply changing and
restoring using seteuid(); there is a body of opinion that seteuid() cannot be
used safely. From release 4, Exim no longer makes any use of it. Besides, not
all systems have seteuid().

If the uid/gid are specified in the transport_instance, they are used; the
transport initialization must ensure that either both or neither are set.
Otherwise, the values associated with the address are used. If neither are set,
it is a configuration error.

The transport or the address may specify a home directory (transport over-
rides), and if they do, this is set as $home. If neither have set a working
directory, this value is used for that as well. Otherwise $home is left unset
and the cwd is set to "/" - a directory that should be accessible to all users.

Using a separate process makes it more complicated to get error information
back. We use a pipe to pass the return code and also an error code and error
text string back to the parent process.

Arguments:
  addr       points to an address block for this delivery; for "normal" local
             deliveries this is the only address to be delivered, but for
             pseudo-remote deliveries (e.g. by batch SMTP to a file or pipe)
             a number of addresses can be handled simultaneously, and in this

  Thus we inhibit core-dumps completely but let individual transports, while

*************************************************/

/* This function is called when the subprocess is complete, but can also be
called before it is complete, in order to empty a pipe that is full (to prevent
deadlock). It must therefore keep track of its progress in the parlist data
block.

We read the pipe to get the delivery status codes and a possible error message
for each address, optionally preceded by unusability data for the hosts and
also by optional retry data.

Read in large chunks into the big buffer and then scan through, interpreting
the data therein. In most cases, only a single read will be necessary. No
individual item will ever be anywhere near 2500 bytes in length, so by ensuring
that we read the next chunk when there is less than 2500 bytes left in the
non-final chunk, we can assume each item is complete in the buffer before
handling it. Each item is written using a single write(), which is atomic for
small items (less than PIPE_BUF, which seems to be at least 512 in any Unix and
often bigger) so even if we are reading while the subprocess is still going, we
should never have only a partial item in the buffer.

Argument:
  poffset     the offset of the parlist item
  eop         TRUE if the process has completed

Returns:      TRUE if the terminating 'Z' item has been read,
              or there has been a disaster (i.e. no more data needed);

which returns 0 for both end of file and no more data. We distinguish the
two cases by taking 0 as end of file only when we know the process has
completed.

Each separate item is written to the pipe in a single write(), and as they are

/* Loop until either a subprocess completes, or there are no subprocesses in
existence - in which case give an error return. We cannot proceed just by
waiting for a completion, because a subprocess may have filled up its pipe, and
be waiting for it to be emptied. Therefore, if no processes have finished, we
wait for one of the pipes to acquire some data by calling select(), with a
timeout just in case.

The simple approach is just to iterate after reading data from a ready pipe.
This leads to non-ideal behaviour when the subprocess has written its final Z
item, closed the pipe, and is in the process of exiting (the common case). A
call to waitpid() yields nothing completed, but select() shows the pipe ready -
reading it yields EOF, so you end up with busy-waiting until the subprocess has
actually finished.

To avoid this, if all the data that is needed has been read from a subprocess
after select(), an explicit wait() for it is done. We know that all it is doing
is writing to the pipe and then exiting, so the wait should not be long.

The non-blocking waitpid() is to some extent just insurance; if we could
reliably detect end-of-file on the pipe, we could always know when to do a
blocking wait() for a completed process. However, because some systems use
NDELAY, which doesn't distinguish between EOF and pipe empty, it is easier to
use code that functions without the need to recognize EOF.

There's a double loop here just in case we end up with a process that is not in
the list of remote delivery processes. Something has obviously gone wrong if
this is the case. (For example, a process that is incorrectly left over from
routing or local deliveries might be found.) The damage can be minimized by
looping back and looking for another process. If there aren't any, the error
return will happen. */

    either means invalid options (which we discount), or that this process was
    interrupted by a signal. Just loop to try the waitpid() again.

    If errno == ECHILD, waitpid() is telling us that there are no subprocesses
    in existence. This should never happen, and is an unexpected error.
    However, there is a nasty complication when running under Linux. If "strace
    -f" is being used under Linux to trace this process and its children,
    subprocesses are "stolen" from their parents and become the children of the
    tracing process. A general wait such as the one we've just obeyed returns
    as if there are no children while subprocesses are running. Once a
    subprocess completes, it is restored to the parent, and waitpid(-1) finds
    it. Thanks to Joachim Wieland for finding all this out and suggesting a
    palliative.

    This does not happen using "truss" on Solaris, nor (I think) with other
    tracing facilities on other OS. It seems to be specific to Linux.

    What we do to get round this is to use kill() to see if any of our
    subprocesses are still in existence. If kill() gives an OK return, we know
    it must be for one of our processes - it can't be for a re-use of the pid,
    because if our process had finished, waitpid() would have found it. If any
    of our subprocesses are in existence, we proceed to use select() as if
    waitpid() had returned zero. I think this is safe. */

  /*****    This is slightly experimental code, but should be safe.   *****/

  /* The address_count_max value is the maximum number of addresses that the
  transport can send in one envelope. However, the transport must be capable of
  dealing with any number of addresses. If the number it gets exceeds its
  envelope limitation, it must send multiple copies of the message. This can be
  done over a single connection for SMTP, so uses less resources than making
  multiple connections. On the other hand, if remote_max_parallel is greater
  than one, it is perhaps a good idea to use parallel processing to move the
  message faster, even if that results in multiple simultaneous connections to
  the same host.

  How can we come to some compromise between these two ideals? What we do is to
  limit the number of addresses passed to a single instance of a transport to
  the greater of (a) its address limit (rcpt_max for SMTP) and (b) the total
  number of addresses routed to remote transports divided by
  remote_max_parallel. For example, if the message has 100 remote recipients,
  remote max parallel is 2, and rcpt_max is 10, we'd never send more than 50 at
  once. But if rcpt_max is 100, we could send up to 100.

  Of course, not all the remotely addresses in a message are going to go to the
  same set of hosts (except in smarthost configurations), so this is just a
  heuristic way of dividing up the work.

  Furthermore (1), because this may not be wanted in some cases, and also to
  cope with really pathological cases, there is also a limit to the number of
  messages that are sent over one connection. This is the same limit that is
  used when sending several different messages over the same connection.
  Continue_sequence is set when in this situation, to the number sent so
  far, including this message.

  Furthermore (2), when somebody explicitly sets the maximum value to 1, it
  is probably because they are using VERP, in which case they want to pass only
  one address at a time to the transport, in order to be able to use
  $local_part and $domain in constructing a new return path. We could test for
  the use of these variables, but as it is so likely they will be used when the
  maximum is 1, we don't bother. Just leave the value alone. */

   have set the allow flags into the address, and also set the uid/gid required.
   Having the routers generate new addresses and then checking them here at
   the outer level is tidier than making each router do the checking, and
   means that routers don't need access to the failed address queue.

 . Break up the address into local part and domain, and make lowercased
   versions of these strings. We also make unquoted versions of the local part.

 . Handle the percent hack for those domains for which it is valid.

 . For child addresses, determine if any of the parents have the same address.
   If so, generate a different string for previous delivery checking. Without
   this code, if the address spqr generates spqr via a forward or alias file,
   delivery of the generated spqr stops further attempts at the top level spqr,
   which is not what is wanted - it may have generated other addresses.

 . Check on the retry database to see if routing was previously deferred, but
   only if in a queue run. Addresses that are to be routed are put on the
   addr_route chain. Addresses that are to be deferred are put on the
   addr_defer chain. We do all the checking first, so as not to keep the
   retry database open any longer than necessary.

 . Now we run the addresses through the routers. A router may put the address
   on either the addr_local or the addr_remote chain for local or remote
   delivery, respectively, or put it on the addr_failed chain if it is
   undeliveable, or it may generate child addresses and put them on the
   addr_new chain, or it may defer an address. All the chain anchors are
   passed as arguments so that the routers can be called for verification
   purposes as well.

 . If new addresses have been generated by the routers, da capo.

    attempt. If it fails again, the address will be failed. This ensures that
    each address is routed at least once, even after long-term routing
    failures.

    If there is an address retry, check that too; just wait for the next
    retry time. This helps with the case when the temporary error on the
    address was really message-specific rather than address specific, since
    it allows other messages through.

    We also wait for the next retry time if this is a message sent down an
    existing SMTP connection (even though that will be forced). Otherwise there
    will be far too many attempts for an address that gets a 4xx error. In
    fact, after such an error, we should not get here because, the host should
    not be remembered as one this message needs. However, there was a bug that
    used to cause this to  happen, so it is best to be on the safe side.

    Even if we haven't reached the retry time in the hints, there is one more
    check to do, which is for the ultimate address timeout. We only do this
    check if there is an address retry record and there is not a domain retry
    record; this implies that previous attempts to handle the address had the
    retry_use_local_parts option turned on. We use this as an approximation
    for the destination being like a local delivery, for example delivery over
