/* This function is called by the redirect router when it has skipped over one
or more syntax errors in the list of addresses. If there is an address to mail
to, send a message, and always write the information to the log. In the case of
a filter file, a "syntax error" might actually be something else, such as the
inability to open a log file. Thus, the wording of the error message is
general.

Arguments:
  rname             the router name
  eblock            chain of error blocks
  syntax_errors_to  address to send mail to, or NULL
  some              TRUE if some addresses were generated; FALSE if none were
  custom            custom message text

Returns:            FALSE if string expansion failed; TRUE otherwise
