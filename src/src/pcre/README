PCRE for use in Exim
--------------------

This directory used to contain a subset of the files from the PCRE distribution.

However carrying our own subset of PCRE, especially when the vast
majority of systems now have PCRE as a system library, has become a
liability, requiring exim to be manually updated whenever changes are
made in PCRE.

PCRE can be found at http://www.pcre.org/
