header) when the input is not from SMTP - we are receiving a local message on
a standard input stream. The message is always terminated by EOF, and is also
terminated by a dot on a line by itself if the flag dot_ends is TRUE. Split the
two cases for maximum efficiency.

Ensure that the body ends with a newline. This will naturally be the case when
the termination is "\n.\n" but may not be otherwise. The RFC defines messages
as "sequences of lines" - this of course strictly applies only to SMTP, but
deliveries into BSD-type mailbox files also require it. Exim used to have a
flag for doing this at delivery time, but as it was always set for all
transports, I decided to simplify things by putting the check here instead.

There is at least one MUA (dtmail) that sends CRLF via this interface, and
other programs are known to do this as well. Exim used to have a option for
dealing with this: in July 2003, after much discussion, the code has been
changed to default to treat any of LF, CRLF, and bare CR as line terminators.

However, for the case when a dot on a line by itself terminates a message, the
only recognized terminating sequences before and after the dot are LF and CRLF.
Otherwise, having read EOL . CR, you don't know whether to read another
character or not.

Internally, in messages stored in Exim's spool files, LF is used as the line
terminator. Under the new regime, bare CRs will no longer appear in these
files.

*************************************************/

/* Receive a message on the given input, and put it into a pair of spool files.
Either a non-null list of recipients, or the extract flag will be true, or
both. The flag sender_local is true for locally generated messages. The flag
submission_mode is true if an ACL has obeyed "control = submission". The flag
suppress_local_fixups is true if an ACL has obeyed "control =
suppress_local_fixups" or -G was passed on the command-line.
The flag smtp_input is true if the message is to be
handled using SMTP conventions about termination and lines starting with dots.
For non-SMTP messages, dot_ends is true for dot-terminated messages.

If a message was successfully read, message_id[0] will be non-zero.

The general actions of this function are:

  . Read the headers of the message (if any) into a chain of store
    blocks.

  . If there is a "sender:" header and the message is locally originated,
    throw it away, unless the caller is trusted, or unless
    active_local_sender_retain is set - which can only happen if
    active_local_from_check is false.

  . If recipients are to be extracted from the message, build the
    recipients list from the headers, removing any that were on the
    original recipients list (unless extract_addresses_remove_arguments is
    false), and at the same time, remove any bcc header that may be present.

  . Get the spool file for the data, sort out its unique name, open
    and lock it (but don't give it the name yet).

  . Generate a "Message-Id" header if the message doesn't have one, for
    locally-originated messages.

  . Generate a "Received" header.

  . Ensure the recipients list is fully qualified and rewritten if necessary.

  . If there are any rewriting rules, apply them to the sender address
    and also to the headers.

  . If there is no from: header, generate one, for locally-generated messages
    and messages in "submission mode" only.

  . If the sender is local, check that from: is correct, and if not, generate
    a Sender: header, unless message comes from a trusted caller, or this
    feature is disabled by active_local_from_check being false.

  . If there is no "date" header, generate one, for locally-originated
    or submission mode messages only.

  . Copy the rest of the input, or up to a terminating "." if in SMTP or
    dot_ends mode, to the data file. Leave it open, to hold the lock.

  . Write the envelope and the headers to a new file.

  . Set the name for the header file; close it.

  . Set the name for the data file; close it.

Because this function can potentially be called many times in a single
SMTP connection, all store should be got by store_get(), so that it will be
automatically retrieved after the message is accepted.

FUDGE: It seems that sites on the net send out messages with just LF
terminators, despite the warnings in the RFCs, and other MTAs handle this. So
we make the CRs optional in all cases.

July 2003: Bare CRs in messages, especially in header lines, cause trouble. A
new regime is now in place in which bare CRs in header lines are turned into LF
followed by a space, so as not to terminate the header line.

February 2004: A bare LF in a header line in a message whose first line was
terminated by CRLF is treated in the same way as a bare CR.

Arguments:
  extract_recip  TRUE if recipients are to be extracted from the message's
                   headers

Returns:  TRUE   there are more messages to be read (SMTP input)
          FALSE  there are no more messages to be read (non-SMTP input
                 or SMTP connection collapsed, or other failure)

When reading a message for filter testing, the returned value indicates
whether the headers (which is all that is read) were terminated by '.' or
not. */

  find any documentation of this, but for compatibility it had better be
  accepted. Exim restricts it to the case of non-smtp messages, and
  treats it as an alternative to the -f command line option. Thus it is
  ignored except for trusted users or filter testing. Otherwise it is taken
  as the sender address, unless -f was used (sendmail compatibility).

  It further turns out that some UUCPs generate the From_line in a different
  format, e.g.

  From ph10 Fri, 7 Jan 97 14:00:00 GMT

  The regex for matching these things is now capable of recognizing both
  formats (including 2- and 4-digit years in the latter). In fact, the regex
  is now configurable, as is the expansion string to fish out the sender.

  Even further on it has been discovered that some broken clients send

/* Extract recipients from the headers if that is required (the -t option).
Note that this is documented as being done *before* any address rewriting takes
place. There are two possibilities:

(1) According to sendmail documentation for Solaris, IRIX, and HP-UX, any
recipients already listed are to be REMOVED from the message. Smail 3 works
like this. We need to build a non-recipients tree for that list, because in
subsequent processing this data is held in a tree and that's what the
spool_write_header() function expects. Make sure that non-recipient addresses
are fully qualified and rewritten if necessary.

(2) According to other sendmail documentation, -t ADDS extracted recipients to
those in the command line arguments (and it is rumoured some other MTAs do
this). Therefore, there is an option to make Exim behave this way.

*** Notes on "Resent-" header lines ***

The presence of resent-headers in the message makes -t horribly ambiguous.
Experiments with sendmail showed that it uses recipients for all resent-
headers, totally ignoring the concept of "sets of resent- headers" as described
in RFC 2822 section 3.6.6. Sendmail also amalgamates them into a single set
with all the addresses in one instance of each header.

This seems to me not to be at all sensible. Before release 4.20, Exim 4 gave an
error for -t if there were resent- headers in the message. However, after a
discussion on the mailing list, I've learned that there are MUAs that use
resent- headers with -t, and also that the stuff about sets of resent- headers
and their ordering in RFC 2822 is generally ignored. An MUA that submits a
message with -t and resent- header lines makes sure that only *its* resent-
headers are present; previous ones are often renamed as X-resent- for example.

Consequently, Exim has been changed so that, if any resent- header lines are
present, the recipients are taken from all of the appropriate resent- lines,
and not from the ordinary To:, Cc:, etc. */

/* Now build the unique message id. This has changed several times over the
lifetime of Exim. This description was rewritten for Exim 4.14 (February 2003).
Retaining all the history in the comment has become too unwieldy - read
previous release sources if you want it.

The message ID has 3 parts: tttttt-pppppp-ss. Each part is a number in base 62.
The first part is the current time, in seconds. The second part is the current
pid. Both are large enough to hold 32-bit numbers in base 62. The third part
can hold a number in the range 0-3843. It used to be a computed sequence
number, but is now the fractional component of the current time in units of
1/2000 of a second (i.e. a value in the range 0-1999). After a message has been
received, Exim ensures that the timer has ticked at the appropriate level
before proceeding, to avoid duplication if the pid happened to be re-used
within the same time period. It seems likely that most messages will take at
least half a millisecond to be received, so no delay will normally be
necessary. At least for some time...

There is a modification when localhost_number is set. Formerly this was allowed
to be as large as 255. Now it is restricted to the range 0-16, and the final
component of the message id becomes (localhost_number * 200) + fractional time
in units of 1/200 of a second (i.e. a value in the range 0-3399).

Some not-really-Unix operating systems use case-insensitive file names (Darwin,
Cygwin). For these, we have to use base 36 instead of base 62. Luckily, this
still allows the tttttt field to hold a large enough number to last for some
more decades, and the final two-digit field can hold numbers up to 1295, which
is enough for milliseconds (instead of 1/2000 of a second).

However, the pppppp field cannot hold a 32-bit pid, but it can hold a 31-bit
pid, so it is probably safe because pids have to be positive. The
localhost_number is restricted to 0-10 for these hosts, and when it is set, the
final field becomes (localhost_number * 100) + fractional time in centiseconds.

Note that string_base62() returns its data in a static storage block, so it
must be copied before calling string_base62() again. It always returns exactly
6 characters.

There doesn't seem to be anything in the RFC which requires a message id to
start with a letter, but Smail was changed to ensure this. The external form of
the message id (as supplied by string expansion) therefore starts with an
additional leading 'E'. The spool file names do not include this leading
letter and it is not used internally.

NOTE: If ever the format of message ids is changed, the regular expression for
checking that a string is in this format must be updated in a corresponding
way. It appears in the initializing code in exim.c. The macro MESSAGE_ID_LENGTH
must also be changed to reflect the correct string length. The queue-sort code
needs to know the layout. Then, of course, other programs that rely on the
message id format will need updating too. */
