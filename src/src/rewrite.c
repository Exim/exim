*    Qualify and possibly rewrite one header     *
*************************************************/

/* This is called only from rewrite_header() below, either when reading a
message. or when routing, in order to rewrite addresses that get changed by a
router. This is normally the addition of full qualification to a partial
domain. The first rewriting rule in this case is "change routed_old into
routed_new", and it applies to all header lines that contain addresses. Then
header-specific rewriting rules are applied.

Before rewriting can be done, addresses without domains have to be qualified.
This should only be done for messages from "local" senders. This is a difficult
concept to pin down, what with the use of SMTP both as a submission and as a
transmission protocol. Exim normally requires incoming SMTP to contain fully-
qualified addresses, but there are options to permit unqualified ones from
certain hosts. For those hosts only, addresses in headers can also be
qualified. For other hosts, unqualified addresses in headers do not get touched
in any way. For locally sourced messages, unqualified addresses always get
qualified, except when -bnq is used to explicitly suppress this.

Arguments:

/*************************************************
*              Rewrite a header line             *
*************************************************/

/* This function may be passed any old header line. It must detect those which
contain addresses, then then apply any rewriting rules that apply. If
routed_old is NULL, only the configured rewriting rules are consulted.
Otherwise, the rewriting rule is "change routed_old into routed_new", and it
applies to all header lines that contain addresses. Then header-specific
rewriting rules are applied.

The old header line is flagged as "old". Old headers are saved on the spool for
debugging but are never sent to any recipients.

Arguments:
  h              header line to rewrite
  routed_old     if not NULL, this is a rewrite caused by a router, changing
                   this domain into routed_new
  routed_new     new routed domain if routed_old is not NULL
  rewrite_rules  points to chain of rewrite rules
  existflags     bits indicating which rewrites exist
  replace        if TRUE, the new header is inserted into the header chain
                    after the old one, and the old one is marked replaced

Returns:         NULL if header unchanged; otherwise the rewritten header
