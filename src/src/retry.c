*     Set status of a host+address item          *
*************************************************/

/* This function is passed a host_item which contains a host name and an
IP address string. Its job is to set the status of the address if it is not
already set (indicated by hstatus_unknown). The possible values are:

   hstatus_usable    the address is not listed in the unusable tree, and does
                     not have a retry record, OR the time is past the next
                     try time, OR the message has been on the queue for more
                     than the maximum retry time for a failing host

   hstatus_unusable  the address is listed in the unusable tree, or does have
                     a retry record, and the time is not yet at the next retry
                     time.

   hstatus_unusable_expired  as above, but also the retry time has expired
                     for this address.

The reason a delivery is permitted when a message has been around for a very
long time is to allow the ultimate address timeout to operate after a delivery
failure. Otherwise some messages may stick around without being tried for too
long.

If a host retry record is retrieved from the hints database, the time of last
trying is filled into the last_try field of the host block. If a host is
generally usable, a check is made to see if there is a retry delay on this
specific message at this host.

If a non-standard port is being used, it is added to the retry key.

Arguments:
  domain              the address domain
  host                pointer to a host item
  portstring          "" for standard port, ":xxxx" for a non-standard port
  include_ip_address  TRUE to include the address in the key - this is
                        usual, but sometimes is not wanted
  retry_host_key      where to put a pointer to the key for the host-specific
                        retry record, if one is read and the host is usable
  retry_message_key   where to put a pointer to the key for the message+host
                        retry record, if one is read and the host is usable

Returns:    TRUE if the host has expired but is usable because

deferred. In that case there is a delete item for the routing retry, and an
updating item for the delivery.

delivery subprocesses, the address starts "clean", with no retry items carried
in.)

database. The keys start R: for routing delays and T: for transport delays.

        it is larger than the time since first failure. It may be that the
