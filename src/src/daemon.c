/* Do the preparation for setting up a listener on one or more interfaces, and
possible on various ports. This is controlled by the combination of
local_interfaces (which can set IP addresses and ports) and daemon_smtp_port
(which is a list of default ports to use for those items in local_interfaces
that do not specify a port). The -oX command line option can be used to
override one or both of these options.

If local_interfaces is not set, the default is to listen on all interfaces.
When it is set, it can include "all IPvx interfaces" as an item. This is useful
when different ports are in use.

It turns out that listening on all interfaces is messy in an IPv6 world,
because several different implementation approaches have been taken. This code
is now supposed to work with all of them. The point of difference is whether an
IPv6 socket that is listening on all interfaces will receive incoming IPv4
calls or not. We also have to cope with the case when IPv6 libraries exist, but
there is no IPv6 support in the kernel.

. On Solaris, an IPv6 socket will accept IPv4 calls, and give them as mapped
  addresses. However, if an IPv4 socket is also listening on all interfaces,
  calls are directed to the appropriate socket.

. On (some versions of) Linux, an IPv6 socket will accept IPv4 calls, and
  give them as mapped addresses, but an attempt also to listen on an IPv4
  socket on all interfaces causes an error.

. On OpenBSD, an IPv6 socket will not accept IPv4 calls. You have to set up
  two sockets if you want to accept both kinds of call.

. FreeBSD is like OpenBSD, but it has the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option, which
  can be turned off, to make it behave like the versions of Linux described
  above.

. I heard a report that the USAGI IPv6 stack for Linux has implemented
  IPV6_V6ONLY.

So, what we do when IPv6 is supported is as follows:

 (1) After it is set up, the list of interfaces is scanned for wildcard
     addresses. If an IPv6 and an IPv4 wildcard are both found for the same
     port, the list is re-arranged so that they are together, with the IPv6
     wildcard first.

 (2) If the creation of a wildcard IPv6 socket fails, we just log the error and
     carry on if an IPv4 wildcard socket for the same port follows later in the
     list. This allows Exim to carry on in the case when the kernel has no IPv6
     support.

 (3) Having created an IPv6 wildcard socket, we try to set IPV6_V6ONLY if that
     option is defined. However, if setting fails, carry on regardless (but log
     the incident).

 (4) If binding or listening on an IPv6 wildcard socket fails, it is a serious
     error.

 (5) If binding or listening on an IPv4 wildcard socket fails with the error
     EADDRINUSE, and a previous interface was an IPv6 wildcard for the same
     port (which must have succeeded or we wouldn't have got this far), we
     assume we are in the situation where just a single socket is permitted,
     and ignore the error.

Phew!

The preparation code decodes options and sets up the relevant data. We do this
first, so that we can return non-zero if there are any syntax errors, and also
write to stderr. */
