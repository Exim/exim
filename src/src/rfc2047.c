/* This file contains a function for decoding message header lines that may
contain encoded "words" according to the rules described in

  RFC-2047 at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt

The function is a rewritten version of code created by Norihisa Washitake.
The original could be used both inside Exim (as part of a patch) or in a
freestanding form. The original contained some built-in code conversions; I
have chosen only to do code conversions if iconv() is supported by the OS.
Because there were quite a lot of hacks to be done, for a variety of reasons,
I rewrote the code.

You can find the latest version of the original library at

  http://washitake.com/mail/exim/mime/

The code below is almost completely unlike the original. */

/*************************************************
*    Decode and convert an RFC 2047 string       *
*************************************************/

/* There are two functions defined here. The original one was rfc2047_decode()
and it was documented in the local_scan() interface. I needed to add an extra
argument for use by expand_string(), so I created rfc2047_decode2() for that
purpose. The original function became a stub that just supplies NULL for the
new argument (sizeptr).

An RFC 2047-encoded string may contain one or more "words", each of the
form  =?...?.?...?=  with the first ... specifying the character code, the
second being Q (for quoted printable) or B for Base64 encoding. The third ...
is the actual data.

This function first decodes each "word" into bytes from the Q or B encoding.
Then, if provided with the name of a charset encoding, and if iconv() is
available, it attempts to translate the result to the named character set.
If this fails, the binary string is returned with an error message.

If a binary zero is encountered in the decoded string, it is replaced by the
contents of the zeroval argument. For use with Exim headers, the value must not
be 0 because they are handled as zero-terminated strings. When zeroval==0,
lenptr should not be NULL.

Arguments:
    string       the subject string
    lencheck     TRUE to enforce maximum MIME word length
    target       the name of the target encoding for MIME words, or NULL for
                   no charset translation
    zeroval      the value to use for binary zero bytes
    lenptr       if not NULL, the length of the result is returned via
                   this variable
    sizeptr      if not NULL, the length of a new store block in which the
                   result is built is placed here; if no new store is obtained,
                   the value is not changed
    error        for error messages; NULL if no problem; this can be set
                   when the yield is non-NULL if there was a charset
                   translation problem

Returns:         the decoded, converted string, or NULL on error; if there are
                   no MIME words in the string, the original string is returned
