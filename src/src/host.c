The generic list of interfaces is obtained by calling host_build_ifacelist()
for local_interfaces and extra_local_interfaces. This list scanned to remove
duplicates (which may exist with different ports - not relevant here). If
either of the wildcard IP addresses (0.0.0.0 and ::0) are encountered, they are
replaced by the appropriate (IPv4 or IPv6) list of actual local interfaces,
obtained from os_find_running_interfaces().

up a list of alias names, pointed to by sender_host_alias. The list is
NULL-terminated. The incoming address is in sender_host_address, either in
dotted-quad form for IPv4 or in colon-separated form for IPv6.

This function does a thorough check that the names it finds point back to the
incoming IP address. Any that do not are discarded. Note that this is relied on
by the ACL reverse_host_lookup check.

On some systems, get{host,ipnode}byaddr() appears to do this internally, but
this it not universally true. Also, for release 4.30, this function was changed
to do a direct DNS lookup first, by default[1], because it turns out that that
is the only guaranteed way to find all the aliases on some systems. My
experiments indicate that Solaris gethostbyaddr() gives the aliases for but
Linux does not.

[1] The actual order is controlled by the host_lookup_order option.

Arguments:    none
Returns:      OK on success, the answer being placed in the global variable
                sender_host_name, with any aliases in a list hung off

              FAIL if no host name can be found
              DEFER if a temporary error was encountered

The variable host_lookup_msg is set to an empty string on success, or to a
reason for the failure otherwise, in a form suitable for tagging onto an error
message, and also host_lookup_failed is set TRUE if the lookup failed. If there
was a defer, host_lookup_deferred is set TRUE.

Any dynamically constructed string for host_lookup_msg must be in permanent
store, because it might be used for several incoming messages on the same SMTP
connection. */

/* The input is a host_item structure with the name filled in and the address
field set to NULL. We use gethostbyname() or getipnodebyname() or
gethostbyname2(), as appropriate. Of course, these functions may use the DNS,
but they do not do MX processing. It appears, however, that in some systems the
current setting of resolver options is used when one of these functions calls
the resolver. For this reason, we call dns_init() at the start, with arguments
influenced by bits in "flags", just as we do for host_find_bydns().

The second argument provides a host list (usually an IP list) of hosts to
ignore. This makes it possible to ignore IPv6 link-local addresses or loopback
addresses in unreasonable places.

The lookup may result in a change of name. For compatibility with the dns
lookup, return this via fully_qualified_name as well as updating the host item.
The lookup may also yield more than one IP address, in which case chain on
subsequent host_item structures.

  host                   a host item with the name and MX filled in;
                           the address is to be filled in;
                           multiple IP addresses cause other host items to be
                             chained on.

/*************************************************
*        Fill in a host address from the DNS     *
*************************************************/

/* Given a host item, with its name, port and mx fields set, and its address
field set to NULL, fill in its IP address from the DNS. If it is multi-homed,
create additional host items for the additional addresses, copying all the
other fields, and randomizing the order.

On IPv6 systems, A6 records are sought first (but only if support for A6 is
configured - they may never become mainstream), then AAAA records are sought,
and finally A records are sought as well.

The host name may be changed if the DNS returns a different name - e.g. fully
qualified or changed via CNAME. If fully_qualified_name is not NULL, dns_lookup
ensures that it points to the fully qualified name. However, this is the fully
qualified version of the original name; if a CNAME is involved, the actual
canonical host name may be different again, and so we get it directly from the
relevant RR. Note that we do NOT change the mx field of the host item in this
function as it may be called to set the addresses of hosts taken from MX
records.

Arguments:
  host                  points to the host item we're filling in
  lastptr               points to pointer to last host item in a chain of
                          host items (may be updated if host is last and gets
                          extended because multihomed)
  ignore_target_hosts   list of hosts to ignore
  allow_ip              if TRUE, recognize an IP address and return it
  fully_qualified_name  if not NULL, return fully qualified name here if
                          the contents are different (i.e. it must be preset
                          to something)
  dnssec_request	if TRUE request the AD bit
  dnssec_require	if TRUE require the AD bit

Returns:       HOST_FIND_FAILED     couldn't find A record
               HOST_FIND_AGAIN      try again later
               HOST_FOUND           found AAAA and/or A record(s)

first, we add 500 to the random number. Then for any other address records, we
use random numbers in the range 0-499 for AAAA records and 500-999 for A
records.

At this point we remove any duplicates that point to the same host, retaining
only the one with the lowest precedence. We cannot yet check for precedence
greater than that of the local host, because that test cannot be properly done

process records from the additional section in the DNS packet that returned the

records from the additional section. In theory, this has always been a
potential problem, but it is exacerbated by the advent of IPv6. If a host had
several IPv4 addresses and some were not in the additional section, at least
Exim would try the others. However, if a host had both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
and all the IPv4 (say) addresses were absent, Exim would try only for a IPv6
connection, and never try an IPv4 address. When there was only IPv4
connectivity, this was a disaster that did in practice occur.

So, from release 4.61 onwards, we always search for A and AAAA records
explicitly. The names shouldn't point to CNAMES, but we use the general lookup
function that handles them, just in case. If any lookup gives a soft error,
change the default yield.
