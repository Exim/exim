*        Queue address for transport             *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called to put an address onto the local or remote transport
queue, as appropriate. When the driver is for verifying only, a transport need
not be set, in which case it doesn't actually matter which queue the address
gets put on.

The generic uid/gid options are inspected and put into the address if they are
set. For a remote transport, if there are fallback hosts, they are added to the
address.

Arguments:
  addr          the address, with the transport field set (if not verify only)
  paddr_local   pointer to the anchor of the local transport chain
  paddr_remote  pointer to the anchor of the remote transport chain
  rblock        the router block
  pw            password entry if check_local_user was set, or NULL

Returns:        FALSE on error; the only case is failing to get a uid/gid
