If the generated address is the same as one of its ancestors, and the

with a copy of the input address. This is to cope with cases where A is aliased
to B and B has a .forward file pointing to A, though it is usually set on the
forwardfile rather than the aliasfile. We can't just pass on the old
address by returning FAIL, because it must act as a general parent for
generated addresses, and only get marked "done" when all its children are
delivered.
