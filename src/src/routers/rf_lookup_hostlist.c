/*************************************************
*     Look up IP addresses for a set of hosts    *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called by a router to fill in the IP addresses for a set of
hosts that are attached to an address. Each host has its name and MX value set;
and those that need processing have their address fields set NULL. Multihomed
hosts cause additional blocks to be inserted into the chain.

This function also supports pseudo-hosts whose names end with "/MX". In this
case, MX records are looked up for the name, and the list of hosts obtained
replaces the incoming "host". In other words, "x/MX" is shorthand for "those
hosts pointed to by x's MX records".

It is also possible for a port to be specified along with the host name or IP
address. The syntax is to add ":port" on to the end. This doesn't work with
IPv6 addresses, so we allow IP addresses to be enclosed in [] in order to make
this work. The specification of the port must come last, that is, after "/MX"
if that is present.

Arguments:
  rblock               the router block
  addr                 the address being routed
  ignore_target_hosts  list of hosts to ignore
  lookup_type          LK_DEFAULT or LK_BYNAME or LK_BYDNS,
		       plus LK_IPV4_{ONLY,PREFER}
  hff_code             what to do for host find failed
  addr_new             passed to rf_self_action for self=reroute

Returns:               OK
                       DEFER host lookup defer
                       PASS  timeout etc and pass_on_timeout set
                       self_action: PASS, DECLINE, DEFER, FAIL, FREEZE
                       hff_code after host find failed
