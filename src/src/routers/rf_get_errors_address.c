/*************************************************
*        Get errors address for a router         *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called by routers to sort out the errors address for a
particular address. If there is a setting in the router block, then expand and
verify it, and if it works, use it. Otherwise use any setting that is in the
address itself. This might be NULL, meaning unset (the message's sender is then
used). Verification isn't done when the original address is just being
verified, as otherwise there might be routing loops if someone sets up a silly
configuration.

Arguments:
  addr         the input address
  rblock       the router instance
  verify       v_none / v_recipient / v_sender / v_expn
  errors_to    point the errors address here

Returns:       OK if no problem
               DEFER if verifying the address caused a deferment
                 or a big disaster (e.g. expansion failure)

not be a sender address. We also need to save and restore the expansion values

  some confidence that we can deliver to the address, in which case it will be
  a recipient, but on the other hand, it will be passed on in SMTP deliveries
  as a sender. However, I think on balance recipient is right because sender
  verification is really about the *incoming* sender of the message.

  If this code is changed, note that you must set vopt_fake_sender instead of
  vopt_is_recipient, as otherwise sender_address may be altered because
  verify_address() thinks it is dealing with *the* sender of the message. */
