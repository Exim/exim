  . a single SRV record has a host name of "." (=> no service)
  . syntactically invalid mail domain
  . check_secondary_mx set, and local host not in host list

DEFER
  . lookup defer for mx_domains
  . timeout etc on DNS lookup
  . verifying the errors address caused a deferment or a big disaster such
      as an expansion failure (rf_get_errors_address)
  . expanding a headers_{add,remove} string caused a deferment or another
      expansion error (rf_get_munge_headers)
  . a problem in rf_get_transport: no transport when one is needed;
      failed to expand dynamic transport; failed to find dynamic transport
  . failure to expand or find a uid/gid (rf_get_ugid via rf_queue_add)
  . self = "freeze", self = "defer"

PASS
  . timeout etc on DNS lookup and pass_on_timeout set
  . self = "pass"

REROUTED
  . routed to local host, but name was expanded by DNS lookup, so a
      re-routing should take place
  . self = "reroute"

  In both cases the new address will have been set up as a child

FAIL
  . self = "fail"

OK
  added address to addr_local or addr_remote, as appropriate for the
  type of transport; this includes the self="send" case.

/* Set up the first of any widening domains. The code further down copes with
either pre- or post-widening, but at present there is no way to turn on
pre-widening, as actually doing so seems like a rather bad idea, and nobody has
requested it. Pre-widening would cause local abbreviated names to take
precedence over global names. For example, if the domain is "xxx.ch" it might
be something in the "ch" toplevel domain, but it also might be xxx.ch.xyz.com.
The choice of pre- or post-widening affects which takes precedence. If ever
somebody comes up with some kind of requirement for pre-widening, presumably
with some conditions under which it is done, it can be selected here.

The rewrite_headers option works only when routing an address at transport
time, because the alterations to the headers are not persistent so must be
worked out immediately before they are used. Sender addresses are routed for
verification purposes, but never at transport time, so any header changes that
you might expect as a result of sender domain widening do not occur. Therefore
we do not perform widening when verifying sender addresses; however, widening
sender addresses is OK if we do not have to rewrite the headers. A corollary
of this is that if the current address is not the original address, then it
does not appear in the message header so it is also OK to widen. The
suppression of widening for sender addresses is silent because it is the
normal desirable behaviour. */
