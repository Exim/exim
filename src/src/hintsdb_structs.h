1. keyed by localpart@domain -
     Full address was tested and record holds result

2. keyed by domain -
     Domain response upto MAIL FROM:<>, postmaster, random local part;

If a record exists, the result field is either ccache_accept or ccache_reject,
or, for a domain record only, ccache_reject_mfnull when MAIL FROM:<> was
rejected. The other fields, however, (which are only relevant to domain
records) may also contain ccache_unknown if that particular test has not been
done.

Originally, there was only one structure, used for both types. However, it got
expanded for domain records, so it got split. To make it possible for Exim to
handle the old type of record, we retain the old definition. The different
kinds of record can be distinguished by their different lengths. */
