*           Attempt to create a directory        *
*************************************************/

/* All the directories that Exim ever creates for itself are within the spool
directory as defined by spool_directory. We are prepared to create as many as
necessary from that directory downwards, inclusive. However, directory creation
can also be required in appendfile and sieve filters. The making function
therefore has a parent argument, below which the new directories are to go. It
can be NULL if the name is absolute.

If a non-root uid has been specified for exim, and we are currently running as
root, ensure the directory is owned by the non-root id if the parent is the
spool directory.

Arguments:
  parent    parent directory name; if NULL the name must be absolute
  name      directory name within the parent that we want
  mode      mode for the new directory
  panic     if TRUE, panic on failure

Returns:    panic on failure if panic is set; otherwise return FALSE;
            TRUE on success.
