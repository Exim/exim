# Default aliases file, installed by Exim. This file contains no real aliases.
# You should edit it to taste.


# The following alias is required by the mail RFCs 2821 and 2822.
# Set it to the address of a HUMAN who deals with this system's mail problems.

# postmaster: someone@your.domain

# It is also common to set the following alias so that if anybody replies to a
# bounce message from this host, the reply goes to the postmaster.

# mailer-daemon: postmaster


# You should also set up an alias for messages to root, because it is not
# usually a good idea to deliver mail as root.

# root: postmaster

# It is a good idea to redirect any messages sent to system accounts so that
# they don't just get ignored. Here are some common examples:

# bin: root
# daemon: root
# ftp: root
# nobody: root
# operator: root
# uucp: root

# You should check your /etc/passwd for any others.


# Other commonly enountered aliases are:
#
# abuse:       the person dealing with network and mail abuse
# hostmaster:  the person dealing with DNS problems
# webmaster:   the person dealing with your website
