THE XFPT PLAIN TEXT TO XML PROCESSOR
------------------------------------

UNIX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
--------------------------

It should just be a matter of typing

  ./configure
  make
  make install

to get youself an installed xfpt command. There is a man page that lists the
command arguments. However, the main documentation is provided only as a PDF
file in the doc directory. The xfpt source that was used to create the XML that
in turn was used to generate the PDF is also included. You can get rid of xfpt
by "make uninstall".


OTHER SYSTEMS
-------------

xfpt consists almost entirely of Standard C code, and so it should be possible
to compile it on any system with a Standard C compiler and library.
