CVS directory exim/exim-doc/doc-src
-----------------------------------

This directory contains documentation files that are processed in some way in 
order to make the documentation files that form part of Exim distributions. A 
non-standard document processor is currently in use (October 2004), but in the 
long term something more standard will have to take over.
