packages supplied by your distribution or build the new release from the
source, once the release goes public on CRD.

Details
=======

We discovered a vulnerability. We consider the risk of an exploit as
low, you need to have a fairly unusual runtime configuration. Neither
our default runtime configuration nor the runtime configuration shipped
by the Debian distribution is vulnerable.

The vulnerability is exploitable either remotely or locally and could
be used to execute other programs with root privilege.

More details and fixes are not yet public, but will be made public on
CRD, July 25th.
