New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim.
Before a formal release, there may be quite a lot of detail so that people can
test from the snapshots or the CVS before the documentation is updated. Once
the documentation is updated, this file is reduced to a short list.


Version 4.64
------------

 1. ACL variables can now be given arbitrary names, as long as they start with
    "acl_c" or "acl_m" (for connection variables and message variables), are at
    least six characters long, with the sixth character being either a digit or
    an underscore.

 2. There is a new ACL modifier called log_reject_target. It makes it possible
    to specify which logs are used for messages about ACL rejections.

 3. There is a new authenticator called "dovecot". This is an interface to the
    authentication facility of the Dovecot POP/IMAP server, which can support a
    number of authentication methods.

 4. The variable $message_headers_raw provides a concatenation of all the
    messages's headers without any decoding. This is in contrast to
    $message_headers, which does RFC2047 decoding on the header contents.

 5. In a DNS black list, if two domain names, comma-separated, are given, the
    second is used first to do an initial check, making use of any IP value
    restrictions that are set. If there is a match, the first domain is used,
    without any IP value restrictions, to get the TXT record.

 6. All authenticators now have a server_condition option.

 7. There is a new command-line option called -Mset. It is useful only in
    conjunction with -be (that is, when testing string expansions). It must be
    followed by a message id; Exim loads the given message from its spool
    before doing the expansions.

 8. Another similar new command-line option is called -bem. It operates like
    -be except that it must be followed by the name of a file that contains a
    message.

 9. When an address is delayed because of a 4xx response to a RCPT command, it
    is now the combination of sender and recipient that is delayed in
    subsequent queue runs until its retry time is reached.

10. Unary negation and the bitwise logical operators and, or, xor, not, and
    shift, have been added to the eval: and eval10: expansion items.

11. The variables $interface_address and $interface_port have been renamed
    as $received_ip_address and $received_port, to make it clear that they
    relate to message reception rather than delivery. (The old names remain
    available for compatibility.)

12. The "message" modifier can now be used on "accept" and "discard" acl verbs
    to vary the message that is sent when an SMTP command is accepted.


Version 4.63
------------

1. There is a new Boolean option called filter_prepend_home for the redirect
   router.

2. There is a new acl, set by acl_not_smtp_start, which is run right at the
   start of receiving a non-SMTP message, before any of the message has been
   read.

3. When an SMTP error message is specified in a "message" modifier in an ACL,
   or in a :fail: or :defer: message in a redirect router, Exim now checks the
   start of the message for an SMTP error code.

4. There is a new parameter for LDAP lookups called "referrals", which takes
   one of the settings "follow" (the default) or "nofollow".

5. Version 20070721.2 of exipick now included, offering these new options:
    --reverse
        After all other sorting options have bee processed, reverse order
        before displaying messages (-R is synonym).
    --random
        Randomize order of matching messages before displaying.
    --size
        Instead of displaying the matching messages, display the sum
        of their sizes.
    --sort <variable>[,<variable>...]
        Before displaying matching messages, sort the messages according to
        each messages value for each variable.
    --not
        Negate the value for every test (returns inverse output from the
        same criteria without --not).


Version 4.62
------------

1. The ${readsocket expansion item now supports Internet domain sockets as well
   as Unix domain sockets. If the first argument begins "inet:", it must be of
   the form "inet:host:port". The port is mandatory; it may be a number or the
   name of a TCP port in /etc/services. The host may be a name, or it may be an
   IP address. An ip address may optionally be enclosed in square brackets.
   This is best for IPv6 addresses. For example:

     ${readsocket{inet:[::1]:1234}{<request data>}...

   Only a single host name may be given, but if looking it up yield more than
   one IP address, they are each tried in turn until a connection is made. Once
   a connection has been made, the behaviour is as for ${readsocket with a Unix
   domain socket.

2. If a redirect router sets up file or pipe deliveries for more than one
   incoming address, and the relevant transport has batch_max set greater than
   one, a batch delivery now occurs.

3. The appendfile transport has a new option called maildirfolder_create_regex.
   Its value is a regular expression. For a maildir delivery, this is matched
   against the maildir directory; if it matches, Exim ensures that a
   maildirfolder file is created alongside the new, cur, and tmp directories.


Version 4.61
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.61 release. Major new features since
the 4.60 release are:

. An option called disable_ipv6, to disable the use of IPv6 completely.

. An increase in the number of ACL variables to 20 of each type.

. A change to use $auth1, $auth2, and $auth3 in authenticators instead of $1,
  $2, $3, (though those are still set) because the numeric variables get used
  for other things in complicated expansions.

. The default for rfc1413_query_timeout has been changed from 30s to 5s.

. It is possible to use setclassresources() on some BSD OS to control the
  resources used in pipe deliveries.

. A new ACL modifier called add_header, which can be used with any verb.

. More errors are detectable in retry rules.

There are a number of other additions too.


Version 4.60
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.60 release. Major new features since
the 4.50 release are:

. Support for SQLite.

. Support for IGNOREQUOTA in LMTP.

. Extensions to the "submission mode" features.

. Support for Client SMTP Authorization (CSA).

. Support for ratelimiting hosts and users.

. New expansion items to help with the BATV "prvs" scheme.

. A "match_ip" condition, that matches an IP address against a list.

There are many more minor changes.
