New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.


Version 4.51
------------

PH/01 The format in which GnuTLS parameters are written to the gnutls-param
      file in the spool directory has been changed. This change has been made
      to alleviate problems that some people had with the generation of the
      parameters by Exim when /dev/random was exhausted. In this situation,
      Exim would hang until /dev/random acquired some more entropy.

      The new code exports and imports the DH and RSA parameters in PEM
      format. This means that the parameters can be generated externally using
      the certtool command that is part of GnuTLS.

      To replace the parameters with new ones, instead of deleting the file
      and letting Exim re-create it, you can generate new parameters using
      certtool and, when this has been done, replace Exim's cache file by
      renaming. The relevant commands are something like this:

        # rm -f new.params
        # touch new.params
        # chown exim:exim new.params
        # chmod 0400 new.params
        # certtool --generate-privkey --bits 512 >new.params
        # echo "" >>new.params
        # certtool --generate-dh-params --bits 1024 >> new.params
        # mv new.params params

      If Exim never has to generate the parameters itself, the possibility of
      stalling is removed.

PH/02 A new expansion item for dynamically loading and calling a locally-
      written C function is now provided, if Exim is compiled with

        EXPAND_DLFUNC=yes

      set in Local/Makefile. The facility is not included by default (a
      suitable error is given if you try to use it when it is not there.)

      If you enable EXPAND_DLFUNC, you should also be aware of the new redirect
      router option forbid_filter_dlfunc. If you have unprivileged users on
      your system who are permitted to create filter files, you might want to
      set forbid_filter_dlfunc=true in the appropriate router, to stop them
      using ${dlfunc to run code within Exim.

      You load and call an external function like this:

        ${dlfunc{/some/file}{function}{arg1}{arg2}...}

      Once loaded, Exim remembers the dynamically loaded object so that it
      doesn't reload the same object file in the same Exim process (but of
      course Exim does start new processes frequently).

      There may be from zero to eight arguments to the function. When compiling
      a local function that is to be called in this way, local_scan.h should be
      included. The Exim variables and functions that are defined by that API
      are also available for dynamically loaded functions. The function itself
      must have the following type:

        int dlfunction(uschar **yield, int argc, uschar *argv[])

      Where "uschar" is a typedef for "unsigned char" in local_scan.h. The
      function should return one of the following values:

      OK            Success. The string that is placed in "yield" is put into
                    the expanded string that is being built.

      FAIL          A non-forced expansion failure occurs, with the error
                    message taken from "yield", if it is set.

      FAIL_FORCED   A forced expansion failure occurs, with the error message
                    taken from "yield" if it is set.

      ERROR         Same as FAIL, except that a panic log entry is written.

      When compiling a function that is to be used in this way with gcc,
      you need to add -shared to the gcc command. Also, in the Exim build-time
      configuration, you must add -export-dynamic to EXTRALIBS.

TF/01 $received_time is a new expansion variable containing the time and date
      as a number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch when the
      current message was received.

PH/03 There is a new value for RADIUS_LIB_TYPE that can be set in
      Local/Makefile. It is RADIUSCLIENTNEW, and it requests that the new API,
      in use from radiusclient 0.4.0 onwards, be used. It does not appear to be
      possible to detect the different versions automatically.

PH/04 There is a new option called acl_not_smtp_mime that allows you to scan
      MIME parts in non-SMTP messages. It operates in exactly the same way as
      acl_smtp_mime

PH/05 It is now possible to redefine a macro within the configuration file.
      The macro must have been previously defined within the configuration (or
      an included file). A definition on the command line using the -D option
      causes all definitions and redefinitions within the file to be ignored.
      In other words, -D overrides any values that are set in the file.
      Redefinition is specified by using '==' instead of '='. For example:

        MAC1 =  initial value
        ...
        MAC1 == updated value

      Redefinition does not alter the order in which the macros are applied to
      the subsequent lines of the configuration file. It is still the same
      order in which the macros were originally defined. All that changes is
      the macro's value. Redefinition makes it possible to accumulate values.
      For example:

        MAC1 =  initial value
        ...
        MAC1 == MAC1 and something added

      This can be helpful in situations where the configuration file is built
      from a number of other files.

PH/06 Macros may now be defined or redefined between router, transport,
      authenticator, or ACL definitions, as well as in the main part of the
      configuration. They may not, however, be changed within an individual
      driver or ACL, or in the local_scan, retry, or rewrite sections of the
      configuration.

PH/07 $acl_verify_message is now set immediately after the failure of a
      verification in an ACL, and so is available in subsequent modifiers. In
      particular, the message can be preserved by coding like this:

         warn  !verify = sender
               set acl_m0 = $acl_verify_message

      Previously, $acl_verify_message was set only while expanding "message"
      and "log_message" when a very denied access.

PH/08 The redirect router has two new options, sieve_useraddress and
      sieve_subaddress. These are passed to a Sieve filter to specify the :user
      and :subaddress parts of an address. Both options are unset by default.
      However, when a Sieve filter is run, if sieve_useraddress is unset, the
      entire original local part (including any prefix or suffix) is used for
      :user. An unset subaddress is treated as an empty subaddress.

PH/09 Quota values can be followed by G as well as K and M.

PH/10 $message_linecount is a new variable that contains the total number of
      lines in the header and body of the message. Compare $body_linecount,
      which is the count for the body only. During the DATA and
      content-scanning ACLs, $message_linecount contains the number of lines
      received. Before delivery happens (that is, before filters, routers, and
      transports run) the count is increased to include the Received: header
      line that Exim standardly adds, and also any other header lines that are
      added by ACLs. The blank line that separates the message header from the
      body is not counted. Here is an example of the use of this variable in a
      DATA ACL:

        deny message   = Too many lines in message header
             condition = \
               ${if <{250}{${eval: $message_linecount - $body_linecount}}}

      In the MAIL and RCPT ACLs, the value is zero because at that stage the
      message has not yet been received.

PH/11 In a ${run expansion, the variable $value (which contains the standard
      output) is now also usable in the "else" string.

PH/12 In a pipe transport, although a timeout while waiting for the pipe
      process to complete was treated as a delivery failure, a timeout while
      writing the message to the pipe was logged, but erroneously treated as a
      successful delivery. Such timeouts include transport filter timeouts. For
      consistency with the overall process timeout, these timeouts are now
      treated as errors, giving rise to delivery failures by default. However,
      there is now a new Boolean option for the pipe transport called
      timeout_defer, which, if set TRUE, converts the failures into defers for
      both kinds of timeout. A transport filter timeout is now identified in
      the log output.
