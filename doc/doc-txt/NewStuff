New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.

Version 4.61
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.61 release. Major new features since
the 4.60 release are:

. An option called disable_ipv6, to disable the use of IPv6 completely.

. An increase in the number of ACL variables to 20 of each type.

. A change to use $auth1, $auth2, and $auth3 in authenticators instead of $1,
  $2, $3, (though those are still set) because the numeric variables get used
  for other things in complicated expansions.

. The default for rfc4131_query_timeout has been changed from 30s to 5s.

. It is possible to use setclassresources() on some BSD OS to control the
  resources used in pipe deliveries.

. A new ACL modifier called add_header, which can be used with any verb.

. More errors are detectable in retry rules.

There are a number of other additions too.


Version 4.60
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.60 release. Major new features since
the 4.50 release are:

. Support for SQLite.

. Support for IGNOREQUOTA in LMTP.

. Extensions to the "submission mode" features.

. Support for Client SMTP Authorization (CSA).

. Support for ratelimiting hosts and users.

. New expansion items to help with the BATV "prvs" scheme.

. A "match_ip" condition, that matches an IP address against a list.

There are many more minor changes.
