New Features in Exim
--------------------

This file contains descriptions of new features that have been added to Exim,
but have not yet made it into the main manual (which is most conveniently
updated when there is a relatively large batch of changes). The doc/ChangeLog
file contains a listing of all changes, including bug fixes.

Version 4.63
------------

1. There is a new Boolean option called filter_prepend_home for the redirect
   router. It defaults true, for backward compatibility. If a "save" command in
   an Exim filter has a relative path for its argument, and $home is defined,
   it is automatically prepended to the relative path. This action can now be
   prevented by setting filter_prepend_home false.


Version 4.62
------------

1. The ${readsocket expansion item now supports Internet domain sockets as well
   as Unix domain sockets. If the first argument begins "inet:", it must be of
   the form "inet:host:port". The port is mandatory; it may be a number or the
   name of a TCP port in /etc/services. The host may be a name, or it may be an
   IP address. An ip address may optionally be enclosed in square brackets.
   This is best for IPv6 addresses. For example:

     ${readsocket{inet:[::1]:1234}{<request data>}...

   Only a single host name may be given, but if looking it up yield more than
   one IP address, they are each tried in turn until a connection is made. Once
   a connection has been made, the behaviour is as for ${readsocket with a Unix
   domain socket.

2. If a redirect router sets up file or pipe deliveries for more than one
   incoming address, and the relevant transport has batch_max set greater than
   one, a batch delivery now occurs.

3. The appendfile transport has a new option called maildirfolder_create_regex.
   Its value is a regular expression. For a maildir delivery, this is matched
   against the maildir directory; if it matches, Exim ensures that a
   maildirfolder file is created alongside the new, cur, and tmp directories.


Version 4.61
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.61 release. Major new features since
the 4.60 release are:

. An option called disable_ipv6, to disable the use of IPv6 completely.

. An increase in the number of ACL variables to 20 of each type.

. A change to use $auth1, $auth2, and $auth3 in authenticators instead of $1,
  $2, $3, (though those are still set) because the numeric variables get used
  for other things in complicated expansions.

. The default for rfc1413_query_timeout has been changed from 30s to 5s.

. It is possible to use setclassresources() on some BSD OS to control the
  resources used in pipe deliveries.

. A new ACL modifier called add_header, which can be used with any verb.

. More errors are detectable in retry rules.

There are a number of other additions too.


Version 4.60
------------

The documentation is up-to-date for the 4.60 release. Major new features since
the 4.50 release are:

. Support for SQLite.

. Support for IGNOREQUOTA in LMTP.

. Extensions to the "submission mode" features.

. Support for Client SMTP Authorization (CSA).

. Support for ratelimiting hosts and users.

. New expansion items to help with the BATV "prvs" scheme.

. A "match_ip" condition, that matches an IP address against a list.

There are many more minor changes.
