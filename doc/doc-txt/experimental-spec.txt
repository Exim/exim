From time to time, experimental features may be added to Exim.
While a feature  is experimental, there  will be a  build-time
option whose name starts  "EXPERIMENTAL_" that must be  set in
order to include the  feature. This file contains  information
about experimental  features, all  of which  are unstable and
liable to incompatible change.


Brightmail AntiSpam (BMI) support
--------------------------------------------------------------

Brightmail  AntiSpam  is  a  commercial  package.  Please  see
http://www.brightmail.com    for    more    information     on
the product. For  the sake of  clarity, we'll refer  to it  as
"BMI" from now on.


0) BMI concept and implementation overview

In  contrast  to   how  spam-scanning  with   SpamAssassin  is
implemented  in  exiscan-acl,  BMI  is  more  suited  for  per
-recipient  scanning of  messages. However,  each messages  is
scanned  only  once,  but  multiple  "verdicts"  for  multiple
recipients can be  returned from the  BMI server. The  exiscan
implementation  passes  the  message to  the  BMI  server just
before accepting it.  It then adds  the retrieved verdicts  to
the messages header file in the spool. These verdicts can then
be  queried  in  routers,  where  operation  is  per-recipient
instead  of per-message.  To use  BMI, you  need to  take the
following steps:

  1) Compile Exim with BMI support
  2) Set up main BMI options (top section of Exim config file)
  3) Set up ACL control statement (ACL section of the config
     file)
  4) Set up your routers to use BMI verdicts (routers section
     of the config file).
  5) (Optional) Set up per-recipient opt-in information.

These four steps are explained in more details below.

1) Adding support for BMI at compile time

  To compile with BMI support,  you need to link Exim  against
  the  Brightmail  client   SDK,  consisting   of  a   library
  (libbmiclient_single.so)  and  a  header  file  (bmi_api.h).
  You'll also need to explicitly set a flag in the Makefile to
  include BMI support in the Exim binary. Both can be achieved
  with  these lines in Local/Makefile:

  EXPERIMENTAL_BRIGHTMAIL=yes
  CFLAGS=-I/path/to/the/dir/with/the/includefile
  EXTRALIBS_EXIM=-L/path/to/the/dir/with/the/library -lbmiclient_single

  If  you use  other CFLAGS  or EXTRALIBS_EXIM  settings then
  merge the content of these lines with them.

  Note for BMI6.x users: You'll also have to add -lxml2_single
  to the EXTRALIBS_EXIM line. Users of 5.5x do not need to  do
  this.

  You    should     also    include     the    location     of
  libbmiclient_single.so in your dynamic linker  configuration
  file   (usually   /etc/ld.so.conf)   and   run    "ldconfig"
  afterwards, or  else the  produced Exim  binary will  not be
  able to find the library file.


2) Setting up BMI support in the Exim main configuration

  To enable BMI  support in the  main Exim configuration,  you
  should set the path to the main BMI configuration file  with
  the "bmi_config_file" option, like this:

  bmi_config_file = /opt/brightmail/etc/brightmail.cfg

  This must go into section 1 of Exim's configuration file (You
  can  put it  right on  top). If  you omit  this option,  it
  defaults to /opt/brightmail/etc/brightmail.cfg.

  Note for BMI6.x users: This  file is in XML format  in V6.xx
  and its  name is  /opt/brightmail/etc/bmiconfig.xml. So  BMI
  6.x users MUST set the bmi_config_file option.


3) Set up ACL control statement

  To  optimize performance,  it makes  sense only  to process
  messages coming from remote, untrusted sources with the  BMI
  server.  To set  up a  messages for  processing by  the BMI
  server, you MUST set the "bmi_run" control statement in  any
  ACL for an incoming message.  You will typically do this  in
  an "accept"  block in  the "acl_check_rcpt"  ACL. You should
  use the "accept" block(s)  that accept messages from  remote
  servers for your own domain(s). Here is an example that uses
  the "accept" blocks from Exim's default configuration file:


  accept  domains       = +local_domains
          endpass
          verify        = recipient
          control       = bmi_run

  accept  domains       = +relay_to_domains
          endpass
          verify        = recipient
          control       = bmi_run

  If bmi_run  is not  set in  any ACL  during reception of the
  message, it will NOT be passed to the BMI server.


4) Setting up routers to use BMI verdicts

  When a message has been  run through the BMI server,  one or
  more "verdicts" are  present. Different recipients  can have
  different verdicts. Each  recipient is treated  individually
  during routing, so you  can query the verdicts  by recipient
  at  that stage.  From Exim's  view, a  verdict can  have the
  following outcomes:

  o deliver the message normally
  o deliver the message to an alternate location
  o do not deliver the message

  To query  the verdict  for a  recipient, the  implementation
  offers the following tools:


  - Boolean router  preconditions. These  can be  used in  any
    router. For a simple  implementation of BMI, these  may be
    all  that  you  need.  The  following  preconditions   are
    available:

    o bmi_deliver_default

      This  precondition  is  TRUE  if  the  verdict  for  the
      recipient is  to deliver  the message  normally. If  the
      message has not been  processed by the BMI  server, this
      variable defaults to TRUE.

    o bmi_deliver_alternate

      This  precondition  is  TRUE  if  the  verdict  for  the
      recipient  is to  deliver the  message to  an alternate
      location.  You  can  get the  location  string  from the
      $bmi_alt_location expansion variable if you need it. See
      further below. If the message has not been processed  by
      the BMI server, this variable defaults to FALSE.

    o bmi_dont_deliver

      This  precondition  is  TRUE  if  the  verdict  for  the
      recipient  is  NOT  to   deliver  the  message  to   the
      recipient. You will typically use this precondition in a
      top-level blackhole router, like this:

        # don't deliver messages handled by the BMI server
        bmi_blackhole:
          driver = redirect
          bmi_dont_deliver
          data = :blackhole:

      This router should be on top of all others, so  messages
      that should not be delivered do not reach other  routers
      at all. If   the  message  has  not  been  processed  by
      the  BMI server, this variable defaults to FALSE.


  - A list router  precondition to query  if rules "fired"  on
    the message for the recipient. Its name is "bmi_rule". You
    use  it  by  passing it  a  colon-separated  list of  rule
    numbers. You can use this condition to route messages that
    matched specific rules. Here is an example:

      # special router for BMI rule #5, #8 and #11
      bmi_rule_redirect:
        driver = redirect
        bmi_rule = 5:8:11
        data = postmaster@mydomain.com


  - Expansion variables. Several  expansion variables are  set
    during  routing.  You  can  use  them  in  custom   router
    conditions,  for  example.  The  following  variables  are
    available:

    o $bmi_base64_verdict

      This variable  will contain  the BASE64  encoded verdict
      for the recipient being routed. You can use it to add  a
      header to messages for tracking purposes, for example:

      localuser:
        driver = accept
        check_local_user
        headers_add = X-Brightmail-Verdict: $bmi_base64_verdict
        transport = local_delivery

      If there is no verdict available for the recipient being
      routed, this variable contains the empty string.

    o $bmi_base64_tracker_verdict

      This variable  will contain  a BASE64  encoded subset of
      the  verdict  information  concerning  the  "rules" that
      fired  on the  message. You  can add  this string  to a
      header, commonly named "X-Brightmail-Tracker". Example:

      localuser:
        driver = accept
        check_local_user
        headers_add = X-Brightmail-Tracker: $bmi_base64_tracker_verdict
        transport = local_delivery

      If there is no verdict available for the recipient being
      routed, this variable contains the empty string.

    o $bmi_alt_location

      If  the  verdict  is  to  redirect  the  message  to  an
      alternate  location,  this  variable  will  contain  the
      alternate location string returned by the BMI server. In
      its default configuration, this is a header-like  string
      that can be added to the message with "headers_add".  If
      there is  no verdict  available for  the recipient being
      routed, or if the  message is to be  delivered normally,
      this variable contains the empty string.

    o $bmi_deliver

      This is an additional integer variable that can be  used
      to query if the message should be delivered at all.  You
      should use router preconditions instead if possible.

      $bmi_deliver is '0': the message should NOT be delivered.
      $bmi_deliver is '1': the message should be delivered.


  IMPORTANT NOTE: Verdict inheritance.
  The  message  is passed  to  the BMI  server  during message
  reception,  using the  target addresses  from the  RCPT TO:
  commands in the SMTP transaction. If recipients get expanded
  or re-written (for example by aliasing), the new address(es)
  inherit the  verdict from  the original  address. This means
  that verdicts also apply to all "child" addresses  generated
  from top-level addresses that were sent to the BMI server.


5) Using per-recipient opt-in information (Optional)

  The  BMI server  features multiple  scanning "profiles"  for
  individual recipients.  These are  usually stored  in a LDAP
  server and are  queried by the  BMI server itself.  However,
  you can also  pass opt-in data  for each recipient  from the
  MTA to the  BMI server. This  is particularly useful  if you
  already look  up recipient  data in  Exim anyway  (which can
  also be  stored in  a SQL  database or  other source).  This
  implementation enables you  to pass opt-in  data to the  BMI
  server  in  the  RCPT   ACL.  This  works  by   setting  the
  'bmi_optin' modifier in  a block of  that ACL. If  should be
  set to a list  of comma-separated strings that  identify the
  features which the BMI server should use for that particular
  recipient. Ideally, you  would use the  'bmi_optin' modifier
  in the same  ACL block where  you set the  'bmi_run' control
  flag. Here is an example that will pull opt-in data for each
  recipient      from       a      flat       file      called
  '/etc/exim/bmi_optin_data'.

  The file format:

    user1@mydomain.com: <OPTIN STRING1>:<OPTIN STRING2>
    user2@thatdomain.com: <OPTIN STRING3>


  The example:

    accept  domains       = +relay_to_domains
            endpass
            verify        = recipient
            bmi_optin     = ${lookup{$local_part@$domain}lsearch{/etc/exim/bmi_optin_data}}
            control       = bmi_run

  Of course,  you can  also use  any other  lookup method that
  Exim supports, including LDAP, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle etc.,
  as long as  the result is  a list of  colon-separated opt-in
  strings.

  For a list of available opt-in strings, please contact  your
  Brightmail representative.




SRS (Sender Rewriting Scheme) Support
--------------------------------------------------------------

Exiscan  currently  includes SRS  support  via Miles  Wilton's
libsrs_alt library. The current version of the supported
library is 0.5, there are reports of 1.0 working.

In order to  use SRS, you  must get a  copy of libsrs_alt from

https://opsec.eu/src/srs/

(not the original source, which has disappeared.)

Unpack the tarball, then refer to MTAs/README.EXIM
to proceed. You need to set

EXPERIMENTAL_SRS=yes

in your Local/Makefile.



DCC Support
--------------------------------------------------------------
Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse; http://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/

*) Building exim

In order to build exim with DCC support add

EXPERIMENTAL_DCC=yes

to your Makefile. (Re-)build/install exim. exim -d should show
EXPERIMENTAL_DCC under "Support for".


*) Configuration

In the main section of exim.cf add at least
  dccifd_address = /usr/local/dcc/var/dccifd
or
  dccifd_address = <ip> <port>

In the DATA ACL you can use the new condition
        dcc = *

After that "$dcc_header" contains the X-DCC-Header.

Return values are:
  fail    for overall "R", "G" from dccifd
  defer   for overall "T" from dccifd
  accept  for overall "A", "S" from dccifd

dcc = */defer_ok works as for spamd.

The "$dcc_result" variable contains the overall result from DCC
answer.  There will an X-DCC: header added to the mail.

Usually you'll use
  defer   !dcc = *
to greylist with DCC.

If you set, in the main section,
  dcc_direct_add_header = true
then the dcc header will be added "in deep" and if the spool
file was already written it gets removed. This forces Exim to
write it again if needed.  This helps to get the DCC Header
through to eg. SpamAssassin.

If you want to pass even more headers in the middle of the
DATA stage you can set
  $acl_m_dcc_add_header
to tell the DCC routines to add more information; eg, you might set
this to some results from ClamAV.  Be careful.  Header syntax is
not checked and is added "as is".

In case you've troubles with sites sending the same queue items from several
hosts and fail to get through greylisting you can use
$acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip

Setting $acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip to an IP address overrides the default
of $sender_host_address. eg. use the following ACL in DATA stage:

  warn    set acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip = \
    ${lookup{$sender_helo_name}nwildlsearch{/etc/mail/multipleip_sites}{$value}{}}
          condition = ${if def:acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip}
          log_message = dbg: acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip set to \
                        $acl_m_dcc_override_client_ip

Then set something like
# cat /etc/mail/multipleip_sites
mout-xforward.gmx.net           82.165.159.12
mout.gmx.net                    212.227.15.16

Use a reasonable IP. eg. one the sending cluster actually uses.

DMARC Support
--------------------------------------------------------------

DMARC combines feedback from SPF, DKIM, and header From: in order
to attempt to provide better indicators of the authenticity of an
email.  This document does not explain the fundamentals, you
should read and understand how it works by visiting the website at
http://www.dmarc.org/.

DMARC support is added via the libopendmarc library.  Visit:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/opendmarc/

to obtain a copy, or find it in your favorite rpm package
repository.  If building from source, this description assumes
that headers will be in /usr/local/include, and that the libraries
are in /usr/local/lib.

1. To compile Exim with DMARC support, you must first enable SPF.
Please read the above section on enabling the EXPERIMENTAL_SPF
feature.  You must also have DKIM support, so you cannot set the
DISABLE_DKIM feature.  Once both of those conditions have been met
you can enable DMARC in Local/Makefile:

EXPERIMENTAL_DMARC=yes
LDFLAGS += -lopendmarc
# CFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include
# LDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib

The first line sets the feature to include the correct code, and
the second line says to link the libopendmarc libraries into the
exim binary.  The commented out lines should be uncommented if you
built opendmarc from source and installed in the default location.
Adjust the paths if you installed them elsewhere, but you do not
need to uncomment them if an rpm (or you) installed them in the
package controlled locations (/usr/include and /usr/lib).


2. Use the following global settings to configure DMARC:

Optional:
dmarc_tld_file      Defines the location of a text file of valid
                    top level domains the opendmarc library uses
                    during domain parsing. Maintained by Mozilla,
                    the most current version can be downloaded
                    from a link at http://publicsuffix.org/list/.
                    If unset, "/etc/exim/opendmarc.tlds" (hardcoded)
                    is used.

Optional:
dmarc_history_file  Defines the location of a file to log results
                    of dmarc verification on inbound emails. The
                    contents are importable by the opendmarc tools
                    which will manage the data, send out DMARC
                    reports, and expire the data. Make sure the
                    directory of this file is writable by the user
                    exim runs as.

dmarc_forensic_sender The email address to use when sending a
                    forensic report detailing alignment failures
                    if a sender domain's dmarc record specifies it
                    and you have configured Exim to send them.
                    Default: do-not-reply@$default_hostname


3. By default, the DMARC processing will run for any remote,
non-authenticated user.  It makes sense to only verify DMARC
status of messages coming from remote, untrusted sources.  You can
use standard conditions such as hosts, senders, etc, to decide that
DMARC verification should *not* be performed for them and disable
DMARC with a control setting:

  control = dmarc_disable_verify

A DMARC record can also specify a "forensic address", which gives
exim an email address to submit reports about failed alignment.
Exim does not do this by default because in certain conditions it
results in unintended information leakage (what lists a user might
be subscribed to, etc).  You must configure exim to submit forensic
reports to the owner of the domain.  If the DMARC record contains a
forensic address and you specify the control statement below, then
exim will send these forensic emails.  It's also advised that you
configure a dmarc_forensic_sender because the default sender address
construction might be inadequate.

  control = dmarc_enable_forensic

(AGAIN: You can choose not to send these forensic reports by simply
not putting the dmarc_enable_forensic control line at any point in
your exim config.  If you don't tell it to send them, it will not
send them.)

There are no options to either control.  Both must appear before
the DATA acl.


4. You can now run DMARC checks in incoming SMTP by using the
"dmarc_status" ACL condition in the DATA ACL.  You are required to
call the spf condition first in the ACLs, then the "dmarc_status"
condition.  Putting this condition in the ACLs is required in order
for a DMARC check to actually occur.  All of the variables are set
up before the DATA ACL, but there is no actual DMARC check that
occurs until a "dmarc_status" condition is encountered in the ACLs.

The dmarc_status condition takes a list of strings on its
right-hand side.  These strings describe recommended action based
on the DMARC check.  To understand what the policy recommendations
mean, refer to the DMARC website above.  Valid strings are:

  o accept      The DMARC check passed and the library recommends
                accepting the email.
  o reject      The DMARC check failed and the library recommends
                rejecting the email.
  o quarantine  The DMARC check failed and the library recommends
                keeping it for further inspection.
  o none        The DMARC check passed and the library recommends
                no specific action, neutral.
  o norecord    No policy section in the DMARC record for this
                sender domain.
  o nofrom      Unable to determine the domain of the sender.
  o temperror   Library error or dns error.
  o off         The DMARC check was disabled for this email.

You can prefix each string with an exclamation mark to invert its
meaning, for example "!accept" will match all results but
"accept".  The string list is evaluated left-to-right in a
short-circuit fashion.  When a string matches the outcome of the
DMARC check, the condition succeeds.  If none of the listed
strings matches the outcome of the DMARC check, the condition
fails.

Of course, you can also use any other lookup method that Exim
supports, including LDAP, Postgres, MySQL, etc, as long as the
result is a list of colon-separated strings.

Several expansion variables are set before the DATA ACL is
processed, and you can use them in this ACL.  The following
expansion variables are available:

  o $dmarc_status
    This is a one word status indicating what the DMARC library
    thinks of the email.  It is a combination of the results of
    DMARC record lookup and the SPF/DKIM/DMARC processing results
    (if a DMARC record was found).  The actual policy declared
    in the DMARC record is in a separate expansion variable.

  o $dmarc_status_text
    This is a slightly longer, human readable status.

  o $dmarc_used_domain
    This is the domain which DMARC used to look up the DMARC
    policy record.

  o $dmarc_domain_policy
    This is the policy declared in the DMARC record.  Valid values
    are "none", "reject" and "quarantine".  It is blank when there
    is any error, including no DMARC record.

  o $dmarc_ar_header
    This is the entire Authentication-Results header which you can
    add using an add_header modifier.


5. How to enable DMARC advanced operation:
By default, Exim's DMARC configuration is intended to be
non-intrusive and conservative.  To facilitate this, Exim will not
create any type of logging files without explicit configuration by
you, the admin.  Nor will Exim send out any emails/reports about
DMARC issues without explicit configuration by you, the admin (other
than typical bounce messages that may come about due to ACL
processing or failure delivery issues).

In order to log statistics suitable to be imported by the opendmarc
tools, you need to:
a. Configure the global setting dmarc_history_file.
b. Configure cron jobs to call the appropriate opendmarc history
   import scripts and truncating the dmarc_history_file.

In order to send forensic reports, you need to:
a. Configure the global setting dmarc_forensic_sender.
b. Configure, somewhere before the DATA ACL, the control option to
   enable sending DMARC forensic reports.


6. Example usage:
(RCPT ACL)
  warn    domains        = +local_domains
          hosts          = +local_hosts
          control        = dmarc_disable_verify

  warn    !domains       = +screwed_up_dmarc_records
          control        = dmarc_enable_forensic

  warn    condition      = (lookup if destined to mailing list)
          set acl_m_mailing_list = 1

(DATA ACL)
  warn    dmarc_status   = accept : none : off
          !authenticated = *
          log_message    = DMARC DEBUG: $dmarc_status $dmarc_used_domain
          add_header     = $dmarc_ar_header

  warn    dmarc_status   = !accept
          !authenticated = *
          log_message    = DMARC DEBUG: '$dmarc_status' for $dmarc_used_domain

  warn    dmarc_status   = quarantine
          !authenticated = *
          set $acl_m_quarantine = 1
          # Do something in a transport with this flag variable

  deny    condition      = ${if eq{$dmarc_domain_policy}{reject}}
          condition      = ${if eq{$acl_m_mailing_list}{1}}
          message        = Messages from $dmarc_used_domain break mailing lists

  deny    dmarc_status   = reject
          !authenticated = *
          message        = Message from $dmarc_used_domain failed sender's DMARC policy, REJECT



DANE
------------------------------------------------------------
DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities, as applied
to SMTP over TLS, provides assurance to a client that
it is actually talking to the server it wants to rather
than some attacker operating a Man In The Middle (MITM)
operation.  The latter can terminate the TLS connection
you make, and make another one to the server (so both
you and the server still think you have an encrypted
connection) and, if one of the "well known" set of
Certificate Authorities has been suborned - something
which *has* been seen already (2014), a verifiable
certificate (if you're using normal root CAs, eg. the
Mozilla set, as your trust anchors).

What DANE does is replace the CAs with the DNS as the
trust anchor.  The assurance is limited to a) the possibility
that the DNS has been suborned, b) mistakes made by the
admins of the target server.   The attack surface presented
by (a) is thought to be smaller than that of the set
of root CAs.

It also allows the server to declare (implicitly) that
connections to it should use TLS.  An MITM could simply
fail to pass on a server's STARTTLS.

DANE scales better than having to maintain (and
side-channel communicate) copies of server certificates
for every possible target server.  It also scales
(slightly) better than having to maintain on an SMTP
client a copy of the standard CAs bundle.  It also
means not having to pay a CA for certificates.

DANE requires a server operator to do three things:
1) run DNSSEC.  This provides assurance to clients
that DNS lookups they do for the server have not
been tampered with.  The domain MX record applying
to this server, its A record, its TLSA record and
any associated CNAME records must all be covered by
DNSSEC.
2) add TLSA DNS records.  These say what the server
certificate for a TLS connection should be.
3) offer a server certificate, or certificate chain,
in TLS connections which is traceable to the one
defined by (one of?) the TSLA records

There are no changes to Exim specific to server-side
operation of DANE.

The TLSA record for the server may have "certificate
usage" of DANE-TA(2) or DANE-EE(3).  The latter specifies
the End Entity directly, i.e. the certificate involved
is that of the server (and should be the sole one transmitted
during the TLS handshake); this is appropriate for a
single system, using a self-signed certificate.
  DANE-TA usage is effectively declaring a specific CA
to be used; this might be a private CA or a public,
well-known one.  A private CA at simplest is just
a self-signed certificate which is used to sign
cerver certificates, but running one securely does
require careful arrangement.  If a private CA is used
then either all clients must be primed with it, or
(probably simpler) the server TLS handshake must transmit
the entire certificate chain from CA to server-certificate.
If a public CA is used then all clients must be primed with it
(losing one advantage of DANE) - but the attack surface is
reduced from all public CAs to that single CA.
DANE-TA is commonly used for several services and/or
servers, each having a TLSA query-domain CNAME record,
all of which point to a single TLSA record.

The TLSA record should have a Selector field of SPKI(1)
and a Matching Type field of SHA2-512(2).

At the time of writing, https://www.huque.com/bin/gen_tlsa
is useful for quickly generating TLSA records; and commands like

  openssl x509 -in -pubkey -noout <certificate.pem \
  | openssl rsa -outform der -pubin 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl sha512 \
  | awk '{print $2}'

are workable for 4th-field hashes.

For use with the DANE-TA model, server certificates
must have a correct name (SubjectName or SubjectAltName).

The use of OCSP-stapling should be considered, allowing
for fast revocation of certificates (which would otherwise
be limited by the DNS TTL on the TLSA records).  However,
this is likely to only be usable with DANE-TA.  NOTE: the
default of requesting OCSP for all hosts is modified iff
DANE is in use, to:

  hosts_request_ocsp = ${if or { {= {0}{$tls_out_tlsa_usage}} \
				 {= {4}{$tls_out_tlsa_usage}} } \
                         {*}{}}

The (new) variable $tls_out_tlsa_usage is a bitfield with
numbered bits set for TLSA record usage codes.
The zero above means DANE was not in use,
the four means that only DANE-TA usage TLSA records were
found. If the definition of hosts_request_ocsp includes the
string "tls_out_tlsa_usage", they are re-expanded in time to
control the OCSP request.

This modification of hosts_request_ocsp is only done if
it has the default value of "*".  Admins who change it, and
those who use hosts_require_ocsp, should consider the interaction
with DANE in their OCSP settings.


For client-side DANE there are two new smtp transport options,
hosts_try_dane and hosts_require_dane.
[ should they be domain-based rather than host-based? ]

Hosts_require_dane will result in failure if the target host
is not DNSSEC-secured.

DANE will only be usable if the target host has DNSSEC-secured
MX, A and TLSA records.

A TLSA lookup will be done if either of the above options match
and the host-lookup succeeded using dnssec.
If a TLSA lookup is done and succeeds, a DANE-verified TLS connection
will be required for the host.  If it does not, the host will not
be used; there is no fallback to non-DANE or non-TLS.

If DANE is requested and useable (see above) the following transport
options are ignored:
  hosts_require_tls
  tls_verify_hosts
  tls_try_verify_hosts
  tls_verify_certificates
  tls_crl
  tls_verify_cert_hostnames

If DANE is not usable, whether requested or not, and CA-anchored
verification evaluation is wanted, the above variables should be set
appropriately.

Currently dnssec_request_domains must be active (need to think about that)
and dnssec_require_domains is ignored.

If verification was successful using DANE then the "CV" item
in the delivery log line will show as "CV=dane".

There is a new variable $tls_out_dane which will have "yes" if
verification succeeded using DANE and "no" otherwise (only useful
in combination with EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT), and a new variable
$tls_out_tlsa_usage (detailed above).

Under GnuTLS, DANE is only supported from versin 3.0.0 onwards



DSN extra information
---------------------
If compiled with EXPERIMENTAL_DSN_INFO extra information will be added
to DSN fail messages ("bounces"), when available.  The intent is to aid
tracing of specific failing messages, when presented with a "bounce"
complaint and needing to search logs.


The remote MTA IP address, with port number if nonstandard.
Example:
  Remote-MTA: X-ip; [127.0.0.1]:587
Rationale:
  Several addresses may correspond to the (already available)
  dns name for the remote MTA.

The remote MTA connect-time greeting.
Example:
  X-Remote-MTA-smtp-greeting: X-str; 220 the.local.host.name ESMTP Exim x.yz Tue, 2 Mar 1999 09:44:33 +0000
Rationale:
  This string sometimes presents the remote MTA's idea of its
  own name, and sometimes identifies the MTA software.

The remote MTA response to HELO or EHLO.
Example:
  X-Remote-MTA-helo-response: X-str; 250-the.local.host.name Hello localhost [127.0.0.1]
Limitations:
  Only the first line of a multiline response is recorded.
Rationale:
  This string sometimes presents the remote MTA's view of
  the peer IP connecting to it.

The reporting MTA detailed diagnostic.
Example:
  X-Exim-Diagnostic: X-str; SMTP error from remote mail server after RCPT TO:<d3@myhost.test.ex>: 550 hard error
Rationale:
  This string sometimes give extra information over the
  existing (already available) Diagnostic-Code field.


Note that non-RFC-documented field names and data types are used.


LMDB Lookup support
-------------------
LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact, crash-proof key-value embedded data store.
It is modeled loosely on the BerkeleyDB API. You should read about the feature
set as well as operation modes at https://symas.com/products/lightning-memory-mapped-database/

LMDB single key lookup support is provided by linking to the LMDB C library.
The current implementation does not support writing to the LMDB database.

Visit https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb to download the library or find it in your
operating systems package repository.

If building from source, this description assumes that headers will be in
/usr/local/include, and that the libraries are in /usr/local/lib.

1. In order to build exim with LMDB lookup support add or uncomment

EXPERIMENTAL_LMDB=yes

to your Local/Makefile. (Re-)build/install exim. exim -d should show
Experimental_LMDB in the line "Support for:".

EXPERIMENTAL_LMDB=yes
LDFLAGS += -llmdb
# CFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include
# LDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib

The first line sets the feature to include the correct code, and
the second line says to link the LMDB libraries into the
exim binary.  The commented out lines should be uncommented if you
built LMDB from source and installed in the default location.
Adjust the paths if you installed them elsewhere, but you do not
need to uncomment them if an rpm (or you) installed them in the
package controlled locations (/usr/include and /usr/lib).

2. Create your LMDB files, you can use the mdb_load utility which is
part of the LMDB distribution our your favourite language bindings.

3. Add the single key lookups to your exim.conf file, example lookups
are below.

${lookup{$sender_address_domain}lmdb{/var/lib/baruwa/data/db/relaydomains.mdb}{$value}}
${lookup{$sender_address_domain}lmdb{/var/lib/baruwa/data/db/relaydomains.mdb}{$value}fail}
${lookup{$sender_address_domain}lmdb{/var/lib/baruwa/data/db/relaydomains.mdb}}


Queuefile transport
-------------------
Queuefile is a pseudo transport which does not perform final delivery.
It simply copies the exim spool files out of the spool directory into
an external directory retaining the exim spool format.

The spool files can then be processed by external processes and then
requeued into exim spool directories for final delivery.

The motivation/inspiration for the transport is to allow external
processes to access email queued by exim and have access to all the
information which would not be available if the messages were delivered
to the process in the standard email formats.

The mailscanner package is one of the processes that can take advantage
of this transport to filter email.

The transport can be used in the same way as the other existing transports,
i.e by configuring a router to route mail to a transport configured with
the queuefile driver.

The transport only takes one option:

* directory - This is used to specify the directory messages should be
copied to

The generic transport options (body_only, current_directory, disable_logging,
debug_print, delivery_date_add, envelope_to_add, event_action, group,
headers_add, headers_only, headers_remove, headers_rewrite, home_directory,
initgroups, max_parallel, message_size_limit, rcpt_include_affixes,
retry_use_local_part, return_path, return_path_add, shadow_condition,
shadow_transport, transport_filter, transport_filter_timeout, user) are
ignored.

Sample configuration:

(Router)

scan:
   driver = accept
   transport = scan

(Transport)

scan:
  driver = queuefile
  directory = /var/spool/baruwa-scanner/input


In order to build exim with Queuefile transport support add or uncomment

EXPERIMENTAL_QUEUEFILE=yes

to your Local/Makefile. (Re-)build/install exim. exim -d should show
Experimental_QUEUEFILE in the line "Support for:".
