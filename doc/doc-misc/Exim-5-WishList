Wishlist for (the mythical) Exim version 5
==========================================

These are ideas that are so incompatible with version 4
that we don't want to do them.

1. Test router preconditions in order given

2. Recast the router syntax to look more like the ACL syntax
   There is no distinction between preconditions and conditions
   (all of which are procedural rather than declarative)
   in the current syntax.

3. Redo the retries syntax, again to be more like ACL syntax.

4. Redo syntax for mysql/pgsql host spec, for better parsing
   - Eg. a proper list, of name=value items
