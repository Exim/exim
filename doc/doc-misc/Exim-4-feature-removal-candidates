Features we might remove
------------------------

Add to the list as we think of them


- IP options
- DSCP
- OCSP stapling: Despite IMHO being a seriously better idea than Revocation
	lists, the Big Boy CAs are removing support in the 2025 timeframe
	(possibly in favour of shortlived leaf certs, which increases their
	loading on renewals and doesn't handle revocation of intermediates)
- ibase lookup
- brightmail
- older Berkeley DB versions
- iplookup router
- older OpenSSL versions
- older GnuTLS versions
- some of the malware scanners and/or variants
