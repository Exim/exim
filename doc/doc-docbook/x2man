.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge.
It is a large program with very many facilities. For a full specification, see
the reference manual. This man page contains only a description of the command
line options. It has been automatically generated from the reference manual
source, hopefully without too much mangling.

.SH DEFAULT ACTION
.rs
.sp
If no options are present that require a specific action (such as starting the
daemon or a queue runner, testing an address, receiving a message in a specific
format, or listing the queue), and there is at least one command line argument,
then \fB-bm\fR (accept a local message on the standard input, with the
arguments specifying the recipients) is assumed. Otherwise, Exim outputs a
brief message about itself and exits.

.SH SETTING OPTIONS BY PROGRAM NAME
.rs
.TP 10
\\fBmailq\\fR
Behave as if the option \\fB\\-bp\\fP were present before any other options.
The \\fB\\-bp\\fP option requests a listing of the contents of the mail queue
on the standard output.
.TP
\\fBrsmtp\\fR
Behaves as if the option \\fB\\-bS\\fP were present before any other options,
for compatibility with Smail. The \\fB\\-bS\\fP option is used for reading in a
number of messages in batched SMTP format.
.TP
\\fBrmail\\fR
Behave as if the \\fB\\-i\\fP and \\fB\\-oee\\fP options were present before
any other options, for compatibility with Smail. The name \\fBrmail\\fR is used
as an interface by some UUCP systems. The \\fB\\-i\\fP option specifies that a
dot on a line by itself does not terminate a non\\-SMTP message; \\fB\\-oee\\fP
requests that errors detected in non\\-SMTP messages be reported by emailing
the sender.
.TP
\\fBrunq\\fR
Behave as if the option \\fB\\-q\\fP were present before any other options, for
compatibility with Smail. The \\fB\\-q\\fP option causes a single queue runner
process to be started. It processes the queue once, then exits.
.TP
\\fBnewaliases\\fR
Behave as if the option \\fB\\-bi\\fP were present before any other options,
for compatibility with Sendmail. This option is used for rebuilding Sendmail's
alias file. Exim does not have the concept of a single alias file, but can be
configured to run a specified command if called with the \\fB\\-bi\\fP option.
