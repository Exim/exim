# There are deliveries in parallel in this script, and the processes that
# run in parallel may not finish in the same order on different hosts. (Indeed,
# they always seem to finish in precisely the opposite orders on Linux and
# FreeBSD.) For that reason, we do a hacked-up sort on the log file right at
# the end, to ensure that the log lines are always in the same order.
