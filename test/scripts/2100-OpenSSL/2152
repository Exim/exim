# TLS client: TLS setup fails - retry in clear (with fastopen)
#
# If all works you'll not see any difference.  To enable in the
# kernel, 'sudo sh -c "echo 3 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen"'.
# A packet capture on the loopback interface will show the TFU
# option on the SYN, but the fast-output SMTP banner will not
# be seen unless you also deliberately emulate a long path:
# 'sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 100ms'
#
# If the client-side is disabled in the kernel, Exim logs
# will become noisy.
