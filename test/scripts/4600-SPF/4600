# The 127.0.0.1 source addr seems to be a builtin in the spf library; no dns lookup is done.
# HOSTIPV4 does get a series of lookups (see server debug output to verify that).
#
# The libspf2 object stack is built with an exim-specific DNS lookup base object,
# so the testsuite intercept to fakedns works.  Be careful of names and addresses
# used, as nonhandled lookups are passed on to real DNS.
