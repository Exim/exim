# For packet-capture, use "runtest -keep" and add (at least) tls debug on the daemon line.
# For GnuTLS, additionally run the daemon under sudo.
# Tell wireshark to use DIR/spool/sslkeys for Master Secret log, and decode TCP/1225 as TLS, TLS/1225 as SMTP
#
# We get (TLS1.3 , OpenSSL):
#    SYN		>
#			< SYN,ACK
#    ACK		>
#    Client Hello	>
#			< Server Hello, Change Ciph, Extensions, Cert, Cert Verify, Finished
#    Change Ciph,Finsh	>
#			< Banner
#    EHLO		>
#			< EHLO resp
#    MAIL,RCPT,DATA	>
#			< ACK,ACK,DATA-go-ahead
#
# GnuTLS splits both the server records and the client response pair over two TCP segments:
#    Client Hello	>
#			< Server Hello, Change Ciph
#    Change Ciph	>
#			< Extensins, Cert, Cert Verify, Finished
#    Finished		>
# (otherwise the same).  The extra segments are piplined and do not incur an extra roundtrip time.
