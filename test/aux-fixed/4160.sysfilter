        directly to one of the XXX hosts. It will be delivered without any further\n\
        action on your part.\n\n\
        However, this indicates some mis-configuration, as new mail should be sent\n\
        (if XXX is involved at all) to smtp.xxx.example, which no longer refers\n\
        to the XXX hosts. It may be that your mail user agent has been configured to\n\
        use (for example) xxx.example or pop.xxx.example where smtp.xxx.example\n\
        would have been correct.\n\n\
        Eventually attempts to send messages directly to the XXX hosts in this way\n\
        will be rejected. You should modify the configuration of your mail user agent\n\
        to correct the fault described above."
