# ----- Retry -----

# Note that these retry rules are not sensible! However, they serve to make
# Exim behave as required in order to run this test. It does not normally make
# sense to have the time limit on the second rule shorter than the first,
# because that means the second rule will never actually be used for retries.
# However, Exim uses the time limit on the final rule to check for the ultimate
# address retry, so what we have here is a total kludge!
