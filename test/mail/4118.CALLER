This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent has not yet been delivered to one or more of its

The subject of the message is: testing a remote defer
The date of the message is:    Tue, 2 Mar 1999 09:44:33 +0000

The address to which the message has not yet been delivered is:
