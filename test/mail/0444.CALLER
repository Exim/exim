You sent the message below from the host

  some.host.name

directly to one of the XXX hosts. It will be delivered without any further
action on your part.

However, this indicates some mis-configuration, as new mail should be sent
(if XXX is involved at all) to smtp.xxx.example, which no longer refers
to the XXX hosts. It may be that your mail user agent has been configured to
use (for example) xxx.example or pop.xxx.example where smtp.xxx.example
would have been correct.

Eventually attempts to send messages directly to the XXX hosts in this way
will be rejected. You should modify the configuration of your mail user agent
to correct the fault described above.
