----

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Source Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at ["General Exim Information"](#general-exim-information).

## General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at [https://code.exim.org/exim/wiki/wiki/EximDevelopment](https://code.exim.org/exim/wiki/wiki/EximDevelopment) - although the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information from the
wiki document.

## Development Repositories

The git repository for the project is at

* Repository:    [https://code.exim.org/exim/exim.git](https://code.exim.org/exim/exim.git)

## Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at [https://bugs.exim.org/](https://bugs.exim.org/)

The bug tracking will be migrated to the issues section of the repository in the near future.

## Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
\- see [https://www.exim.org/maillist.html](https://www.exim.org/maillist.html)

## Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
[https://code.exim.org/exim/wiki/wiki/EximRelease](https://code.exim.org/exim/wiki/wiki/EximRelease).

## General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
[https://www.exim.org/](https://www.exim.org/).

You can find Download locations [https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html](https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html),
Mailing list info [https://www.exim.org/maillist.html](https://www.exim.org/maillist.html) and Full
Documentation [https://www.exim.org/docs.html](https://www.exim.org/docs.html) on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list [https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/](https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/)
for further information.
