# Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further [down](#general-exim-information) this
file.

## General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
our [wiki pages][wiki] - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

## Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a Git
repository. The main repository is accessible at [https://code.exim.org/exim/exim][main-repo].

There is a secondary repository, mirrored at [Github][github-repo],
managed by the Exim Organisation - however this may occasionally fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

## Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using [Bugzilla][bugzilla].
*Please do not* use Github issue tracking.

## Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev [mailing
list](maillist).

## Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found in
this [wiki document][wiki-release]

## General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
[exim.org][exim].

You can find [download locations](https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html),
[mailing list info](https://www.exim.org/maillist.html) and [full
documentation](https://www.exim.org/docs.html) on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/
for further information.
